1. Improved the running speed by adding constraints to prevent words with extremely low probability from being putting into the heap

2. Discussed how to reduce the running time of the initial version of the model

3. Helped debug the program to complete the program

4. Discussed the reason why the probability can not be improved with new model

5. Tested different parameters to improve the accuracy of the old and new models
