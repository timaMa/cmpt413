Designed the CNN model in the Siamese model for extracting features from sentence embeddings.

Tuned hyperparameters so that the model can have a proper training process.

Tried self-attention mechanism to get sentence embeddings.

Drew the figures in the report.

Wrote the approach part in the report.

Analyzed the reasons why our model fails to get better performance.

Wrote the remaining parts of the report with others.
