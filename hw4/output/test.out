i 'm going to tell you about today about the last 30 years of the last 30 years . 
that 's pretty good for 18 minutes . 
it 's a complex issue , so we start right directly to a complex place : new jersey . 
because , before 30 years ago , i was a ago with my parents in new jersey in the city called the , and that was my the . 
at the age of my i was the bathroom that i was with my sister . 
between my bedroom and the bathroom was a hot with the living room . 
there were all around and looked around , so she looked at me , and when i went off the bedroom , and whenever i go and in the , and i would all me . 
and i looked like this . 
i was brilliant , and i hated that . 
i loved this guy , this guy , i hated this room , and this house . 
and that 's architecture . architecture . architecture . architecture . architecture . 
this feeling , my emotions , that 's the power of architecture , because architecture is not about math and the , it 's about the deep , emotional compounds that we have with places where we live . 
and it does n't feel that we feel so , because [ ] percent of americans are 90 percent of their time . 
so we 're 90 percent of our time of architecture . 
this is enormously . 
it means that architecture us in a way that we do n't aware . 
so this makes us something amazing and a very amazing , very wonderful , 
now , when i show you a wonderful building , i know what you think thinking , " power , " stability " and democracy . " 
and they think that because it 's a building that was about two billion years ago from the . 
this is a trick . 
these sorts of architects to make emotional exercise , the shapes that we build our buildings . 
it 's an emotional , and we use this very long time . 
we 're the 200 years from banks . 
we asked him in the 19th century . 
in the 20th century , we built that houses . 
if you look at this , little small soldiers on the ocean and protect the front of . 
it 's very useful , build things is the . 
it 's expensive , it takes long , and it 's very complicated . 
people who build -- and governments , of course , innovation , and they 're rather the that are well - well . 
that leads to buildings like this . 
this is a beautiful building . 
but it does n't have much to do what a library is today . 
in the same year , 2004 , on the other side of the united states , the united states , and it looks like this . 
this is in seattle . 
the library is about the in the digital age . 
it 's about a new way of public space for the city , a place to go to the , and to the . 
how is it possible that in the same year in the same country , two buildings , both libraries , so different ? 
architecture is based on a sort of the . " 
on the one hand , architects are constantly new technologies , new , new solutions for the way we live today . 
we wear all black , they 're very depressed . they keep us for us , but we 're still dead , because we have no choice . 
we need to move the side and the symbols the symbols again that they love . 
when we do that , and they 're happy , we feel like the , so we again , we make the and , over the last 300 years and years in the last 30 years . 
thirty years ago 30 years ago , about the end of the 70s years . 
so architects called the called the . " 
and it was about concrete . 
little windows , the . 
it 's really weird stuff . 
when we met the ' 80s , we began to see these symbols . 
we the back to the other direction . 
we took the shapes that they them , and they them . 
we put the <unk> and some the and , and new material . 
and they loved it . 
they did n't have enough of them . 
we took the <unk> , and we put them into tumors . 
the shapes became large , the and the . 
<unk> have been columns . 
it was crazy . 
but that was the , that was cool . 
that was in the <unk> . 
that was the deal . 
they were easy and cheap , rather than creating places , we create memories to places . 
i know , and i know you know , this is not the <unk> . 
this is a . 
at the end , the beginning , we started with the called " the . " 
we , we found the historical symbols behind us , we ourselves to new , new the and new , new forms of other forms . 
and that was , and exciting , and it was very the , we it with it . 
normally , the would return back . 
but then happened something surprising . 
in 1997 , this building opened . 
this is the <unk> by frank gehry . 
this building changed the relationship to the world of architecture . 
according to paul , the one of the most moments in central , and the public in the building of the building was a opinion . 
the new york times earlier , this building was a miracle . 
the british grew up in two percent of the building . 
it 's our first the . 
now how is it possible that these forms -- and -- how is it possible to spread around the world ? 
and this was happening , because the media had been successfully , and quickly , that these shapes culture , and . 
these shapes gave us an emotional response . 
just like the around the world . 
every mayor knew that these culture and interact with . 
this phenomenon at the <unk> also some other the . 
think about your the . 
10,000 years ago , they would have to go to the village to see a building . 
it turns out : you take a boat , a plane , you 're as a . 
technology : you see it in newspapers , in tv , until we 're all the , and that 's from the . 
architecture is now everywhere , now that is that the speed of the communication has been able to increase the speed of architecture . 
because architecture is because it 's pretty fast . 
it does n't take for a . 
but it takes a building to build a building , three years , and in the meantime , an architect two , eight or a hundred other , before he knows whether he was designed , four years ago , a success or not . 
that 's because of a lot of good in the architecture . 
that 's why we have these buildings . 
it 's never going to happen again , i think , because of the largest revolution in the architecture of the invention of the <unk> , or the , or it 's a the . 
according to the theory of my theory is going to get when you get media , at the same time at the same time , in terms of what in the difference between innovation and innovation , between us , the architects , and you . 
well , we can almost at the point of view of something completely different places . 
this is going to be a project that we recently . 
we 've been able to replace this building . 
this is the center of a city called the in new york in new york . 
it 's a the . 
we 're a building , there 's all sorts of different difference , and we were worried , and the community , and we a series of the that we put on facebook on facebook , and we the people doing what they do doing
it meant that it was two years before , it was a part of the community , because the exactly looked like the <unk> , there was no surprises . 
this building was a part of this community , and in the first summer , when people started to and building the building in the social media , it was no more building , but it became a medium , because that 's not just pictures of a building
so we do n't need a greeks anymore that tell us what we think about architecture . 
we can tell us about what we think about architecture , because the digital media is not only the relationship between us , you have the relationship between us and buildings . 
think about a moment at the . 
if the building today building today , they would like to spend today for the first time and " new . " 
they would begin with experimental , some of that would be to be the limit of what can be a library . 
this is a . 
this is the that they go to the mayor and to take away from the citizens of the , to tell you , there 's not just one answer to what 's library . 
let 's be part of it . 
this particular of experiments gives you the freedom to your own experiment . 
everything has changed . 
architects are not a grateful of creatures , the big words and complicated drawings , and they 're not the public -- the consumers , which is not that he has n't seen . 
architects , you can hear , and architecture does n't . 
this is the end of the <unk> . that means that the future of buildings very different than the current buildings . 
it means that there 's a public space in the of a unique and unique and function of modern . 
a in brooklyn can be a in brooklyn , and not some of the from our from . 
robots are going to build our buildings , because we 're ready to be ready to get them . 
buildings are looking at the outside of nature , rather than different . 
a in florida , florida , there 's be place , where you get sports , and you know , you know , and you can go to the night . 
that means that does n't mean to be a small innovation for innovation , like this little the , which is the same location and how the animals to it . 
so , a building does n't be beautiful to be like this little building in spain , where they 're a , and , and as a concrete , so that there 's this tiny little room , full of and , and
it does n't matter whether a cow our buildings , or build a robot our building our buildings . 
it 's how we build building , it 's just what we build . 
architects , you know how to use the , and build and buildings . 
we 've just found that they it . 
finally , we do n't rely on sides . 
find a architect , they create a architect , they them with better buildings , better cities better and better world , because it 's a lot on the game . 
and only not only our society , it forms to the to the smallest places : the <unk> , the home , where home where they 're their kids , and the path to take them from the <unk> . 
thank you . 
this is my niece , the . 
she 's got a degree and year . 
they 're kind of cool in this way , which is going to run , a the , looking at the slogan " my body is too fast for my legs . 
it looks completely cute . 
and one of their favorite is to look at themselves in the mirror . 
they love her very . 
they 're the , the , and there are big , the . 
when it does n't it be more okay , it does n't seem to ? 
because we do n't seem to do that . 
every month , month people google : " am i ugly ? " 
this is the . the <unk> 13 and in . 
and as everybody wants , you just want to become more and . 
it 's your little bit before . she 's slightly confused , even if your mother is telling her , she says she says she says she says anyone every day every day that she was ugly . 
because your mother tells a and say your friends or friends say something else , you do n't know what you should supposed to do . 
some of them are so that you should not supposed to think about them . 
this is an average , healthy - girls who has this feedback in the face of times life . 
well , the teenagers of today are rarely alone . 
you 're standing under the pressure , and online and be available , you 're talking to write , write , " the , -- it never . 
never before we 've been so connected , so , so , so young . 
a mother said to me , it 's like if every night a night in the room . 
you just did n't have a . 
and the pressure with which is the . 
this self - the - based children on self - based on the number of the , and the kind of comments that you get to . 
there 's no separation between the online and " . " 
what is real and what 's not , is really hard to say . 
what is your source of inspiration ? 
you can see the images that are in the of girls today . 
it 's still with zero and still the . 
now , is today . 
and trends like the <unk> , the <unk> , the , the <unk> and the <unk> . 
by the way , the <unk> stands for the . 
these trends go to the with the and the women of women in the women in the women . 
today , you see easy to go with the girls . 
but the boys are not too immune . 
the pursuit after the <unk> face and the <unk> of the <unk> and the . 
but where is the problem ? 
in fact , we want us to become our children , become more people . 
but in one of the culture - culture , our culture , we 're going to spend more time and thoughts with to look at it , based on the other aspects of their identity . 
so , your relationships , physical development and the school to suffer . 
six 10 months they do n't think because they think they 're not good enough . 
and these are not activities . 
these are fundamental activities in their development as human and as a society and society . 
31 percent , about one three - minute - minute at a discussion in the classroom , they do n't do it because you do n't want attention to your attention . 
one of five do n't go to school when they 're not paying with it . 
if you think about it , if you do n't think good , or especially , especially if you 're not enough , you get the average than you do n't care about those who are n't care about . 
and that 's all the case , in finland , usa , 
and china , and exactly how much you actually . 
to make the whole thing , it 's about how you think you 're thinking , and you do n't know how to actually . 
looks . negative the <unk> . 
but it also the health . 
teenagers , with the <unk> are less , less and vegetables and vegetables , the weight what causes can and can lead to . 
and that does n't change that . 
women , the think they 're dick -- and again , whether you 're or have higher . 
17 percent of women would not go to a when they 're not going to with their . 
think about that what the economy . 
if we could overcome this , what possibilities . 
this is a potential that is in every single one of us . 
but how do we do that ? 
only , it does n't get very far . 
not alone is not enough . 
when we want to move what we need to do something . 
here 's three - first , we need to teach them to teach them . 
we need to help our kids to develop strategies to develop the <unk> and the of the . 
the good news is that there are many programs . 
but the bad news is that most of do n't work . 
i was shocked to see that the programs have the . 
we really need to make sure that the programs that are going to our children , not just a positive , but also a effect . 
the research shows that the best programs six programs : the first of the family 's family , family and relationships . 
secondly , the media and the media , and then the with and , and how we deal with other the and ourselves , and some people call the " the " or " the " and the basis for the
that 's how women are being seen and about how they 're about . 
it 's not okay that we use the contribution of our the because of your brain , the size of your breasts , or to that it 's success of their appearance . 
we need to start looking at their actions , and not what they look like . 
we can all start the responsibility for the images and the comments we 're doing in the social networks . 
we can people for their dignity and do , and do n't look for their appearance . 
and i 'm asking you , when did you have a mirror ? 
we need to educate as communities , governments and work together to move to something , so that our kids can grow their children , and , diversity and diversity . 
we need to get the people who are really going to move a little bit , put them something in the world . 
you 've got to make the stage , because then the changes is changing the world . 
a world where our kids have the freedom to become the best version of their own , in which they 're thinking about what they 're not going to be them , who they really are , or what they want . 
remember what you might mean for somebody in your life . 
a friend ? or the woman who just sitting on something . 
what would it mean for you , if you could get away of that voice , your , your legs , the legs , the , smaller ? smaller ? 
what would it mean for you if we this and that potential to potential ? 
today , all of us are looking at the of our culture . 
let 's tell our children the truth . 
let 's show you that this is just a part of our identity , and we 're going to love them , for what they 're doing and what they give us a sense . 
it has to stop on the curriculum . 
every single one of us should change the way we talk about and talk to others . 
in fact , we work as communities together , from the government to governments , that the government are the by the <unk> of tomorrow . 
let 's do it . 
on the five 1990 , a man named the <unk> in manhattan , and a the - based on the <unk> , the founder of the founder of the <unk> . 
<unk> was first by the of the <unk> , but while he had his for smaller the , and he other men on a dozen new york city , including the and the , the of the united nations . 
fortunately , these plans were taken by a the . 
in fact , the public bank on the world trade center was not the <unk> . 
i was raised in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , as a son of an egyptian the , and an the - and - and - born , who were together to her best to give me a happy . 
it was only when i was seven years ago , began started to change . 
my father showed me a side of the evil that are only few people , including the majority of muslims to see . 
however , in every religion , in every people , a little percentage of people who are so the in their belief that they believe they 're going to do everything in their power to do other things as they live . 
we came at the <unk> that had been our knowledge from the fbi . 
on the day , my last year , the little light on the over the mountain , and to the surprise of all , especially my , the whole goal on in . 
this comment seemed they were going to laugh all very laugh , but , but i only a few years later , which she was really so funny . 
they thought , i had the same the like my father . 
these guys were eventually used to do a the with the pounds of a the on the bottom of the <unk> , and the explosion killed six people and over another thousand . 
in those men , i found . 
these guys called " the , " which is so much " uncle . " 
when i was a the , we were taught , and these were in my childhood , had me to chance to find my friends . 
as soon as soon as i had a little bit , it was time to go to the to the city . 
since i was the new in the class , i was often the victim of the . 
so , i spent most of the time at home . i read books , or tv . 
that 's why i came to the -- to try to express the -- and since i was in a , and i did n't look at the real world . 
i 've been asked to get people to , such as example of their or their . 
so what 's opened me ? 
one of my first experiences that i was thinking about , i was talking about during the . 
when i started to college , i was at the national at the national center in philadelphia . 
the <unk> of my group was the <unk> , and i was almost of my entire life of life , was my subject on me . 
the members of our group came from different social . 
on the day of the day , i found was a boy that i had to was . 
it had a few days , until to detail this detail , and i realized that between two were not natural . 
and i met on people and cultures , and this experience my personality . 
and this feeling makes me feel able to get the that who taught me as a child to deal with 
i do n't know how it is to be gay , but i know very good how it 's to be to be my . 
and then the show . " 
inspiration comes from often comes from the , and the fact that fact , that i think , is my greatest response , as my father is not to me . 
one day i had a conversation with my mother about how to began to change , and she told me to me that i 'm going to live in my heart . 
she saw me with the <unk> eyes of a woman her life her life , and i said , " i 'm suffering to hate people . " 
and in that moment , i understood me how much negative energy is going to take that space . 
<unk> is not my first name . 
i changed it , when my family decided to bring the to my father and a new life . 
so why am i myself me and get it in danger ? 
it 's very simple . 
instead , i use my experiences to try against terrorism , against the <unk> . 
i do it for the victims of terrorism and the , and the of the and pain and loss that gave them in their lives in their lives . 
for the victims of terrorism , i was against the fact , and the of my father . 
with this the fact , i 'm living the living proof that violence is not in religion or religion , and the son does n't matter to the of the . 
i 'm not my father . 
in this moment , there is a movie in your head . 
it 's a , film . 
he 's 3d with all of what you 're seeing right now and hear , but that 's just the beginning . 
your film has smell , taste and touch . 
he has a sense for her body , pain , hunger , the . 
he 's emotions , and joy . 
he has memories , for moments of your childhood that you front of them . 
and he has a very narrator : conscious . 
the <unk> in the film they can play , and you can see all right directly . 
the film is the power of consciousness , the result of how you experience your mind and experience the world . 
consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human . 
each one of us is . 
we all have our own inner , they them , and them . and they them . 
there is nothing that we experience . 
i mean , at least directly my consciousness . 
i ca n't say sure that they 're also aware . 
our consciousness is also what makes life . 
if we were n't aware , there would n't be a sense of our lives . 
at the same time , it 's also the phenomenon of the universe . 
so why do n't we just robots that are all of the input and all the space , without having this inner movie ? 
at that point , nobody knows the answers these questions . 
what i 'm saying is that some of will be ideas to in the field of consciousness . 
some claim , a science of consciousness is impossible . 
science is inherently from . 
consciousness is inherently . 
well , it can never be a science of consciousness . 
for the majority of the 20th century , it was opinion . 
psychologists the behavior of behavior , the brain has the brain , and nobody has the collective consciousness . 
another 30 years ago , when ted was founded , the of consciousness . scientific . 
twenty about 20 years ago . 
and how francis crick and physicists like the <unk> , who has time to come back in science with the consciousness . 
since that time , there was a real explosion . the science of science began to . 
this work is great . it 's great . 
but she also has some basic limits . 
a part of this work , we 've seen by the <unk> , when you see your wonderful work . 
now , we understand , much better much better , which the <unk> with the perception of the , with , or pain or pleasure . 
but that 's still a science of science . 
it 's not a science of explanations . 
we know that these the - specific species with certain species of the , but we do n't know why they do that . 
and i see that this kind of kind of some of the neuroscience some questions to the answers that we answers , and the question of what , what , what , what , and what they are doing . 
but in some way , these are the simple problems . 
nothing against nothing . 
consciousness , there is no easy problems . 
but the does n't solve the real puzzle , the core of this : are all the physical processes of the brain in the brain of consciousness ? 
why does exists of this inner , the movie ? 
so far has no answer to that question . 
now you might think you should be able to give you some couple of years . 
it 's going to be a more phenomenon like , like , like how life , and we 'll be able to explain it . 
the problems of all of these things are all kinds of behavior : how about how , how a organism , and , all of questions . 
you could change this on the human brain , you behaviors and functions of human brain as a human phenomenon , how we how to play how we play , everything questions of behavior . 
but when it comes to consciousness , are asking questions to the problems . 
when it comes to complicated , the question is , all of these behaviors of a an experience . 
students have the of the , even the <unk> of neuroscience , not far much . 
now , science , i 'm a heart . 
i want to take a scientific theory to the consciousness , which works , which works for a long time i 've been looking for a theory of consciousness , which is completely chemical and works , on the . 
but i had to prove that it was n't work for . 
and so i think that we are kind of a . 
we have these wonderful , great knowledge on explanations , so it 's mostly the physics , explains the biology , biology . 
but consciousness does n't seem to fit into this model . 
on the one hand , it is that we are consciously . 
on the other hand , we do n't know how to define this in our scientific behavior . 
and so i think that consciousness is right now right now is a kind of action that we have to do in , but we do n't know exactly . 
now , with some of these ideas could be ideas , and i think we might be able or two ideas that we crazy before we get the conscious . 
there 's a couple of candidates to get these crazy ideas . 
my friend dan , who is here today , one of these ideas . 
he says that there 's no problem with consciousness . 
the whole concept of the internal system is based on a sort of illusion or . 
in fact , we do n't have to explain the function of the brain , and then we have everything explained to be explained . 
i 'm saying , just to that . ! 
this is the kind of ideas that we have to explore , if we have a the and the theory of the consciousness . 
but that , for me , and not many , many other , because they understood the existence of the human consciousness . 
so i 'm going in another way . 
in the time , i want to spend the two ideas that i think they might be . 
the first crazy idea is that consciousness is conscious . 
physicists see some of the aspects of the universe as a fundamental web : space , time and mass . mass . 
they represent the laws in terms of the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics . 
these fundamental properties and laws are not by the . 
they 're seen as a the , and on their basis is the world . 
sometimes it comes out that the list of the fundamental things is fundamental things . 
in the 19th century , we discovered that you ca n't use the phenomenon of non - dimensional things , space , space , time , mass , newton , so he found the laws of the laws and the electrical charge as a fundamental element to which
i think we 're aware of consciousness in the same situation . 
if you have the minds of the existing elements in the existing elements , space , time , mass , mass , then the moral brain that you have to list the list . 
the natural consequence would be to consciousness the consciousness itself as a fundamental element to a nature of nature . 
that does n't mean that you ca n't be science . 
it opens the way to science . 
what we need to do is , is fundamental laws that consciousness the mind with the fundamental elements : space , time , time , mass , physical processes . 
physicists , sometimes , we need the laws that are so simple that you can print on the front of a print . 
i think we are in consciousness with such a situation . 
we want to find a fundamental laws that are so simple that you can print them on a print . 
we do n't yet laws , but we 're working on . 
the second crazy idea is that consciousness could be universal . 
every system could be a certain way of consciousness . 
this view is sometimes as the <unk> : " the stands for everything , " the " for any spirit system , it 's not just people , dogs , dogs , even trees , the microbes . 
even each the has a certain sense of consciousness . 
now , this approach does n't tell us that are intelligent or can think . 
a the is not rich , and thinks , " ah , ah , i love myself at the . 
i can never ever , and i . " 
no , no , no . 
but the idea is that maybe there might be a certain kind of the , sense , a kind of primitive of consciousness . 
that may be a little bit more . 
i mean , why should someone something like this ? 
part of the is in the first crazy idea that idea is that consciousness is . 
if it 's a , space , time and mass , it might be able to be universal , as you as it are . 
you also have to say that this idea that tells us , human beings , other human beings , but we are much less powerful , in cultures that are human minds in nature . 
one more motivation comes from the idea that might be the best way to the fundamental laws between awareness and physical processing , to connect consciousness . 
where there 's there , there 's consciousness . 
complex biology , in humans -- complex awareness . 
simple biology -- simple awareness . 
and what 's exciting is that in the last few years , a the , the , the approach of this theory has an mathematical theory with a mathematical theory . 
he 's the <unk> of the <unk> that he called " in order to measure the <unk> in a system . 
and he 's understood that consciousness with consciousness . 
so in the human brain , so a large amount of large amount of water , a level of a , a lot of consciousness . 
in a mouse , a lot amount of the , still very high -- level of consciousness . 
but if we go further to , microbes , microbes , particles , gravity . 
the <unk> rate , it 's still bigger than zero . 
according to it , it 's still consciousness , which is the zero . 
in fact , he was a act of law of consciousness : respect , consciousness . 
i do n't know if this theory is right , but it could have been the theory in the science of consciousness , and it 's from a whole array of data , and it 's just simply enough to print them on the front of a
another additional is that could help us save the consciousness into the physical world . 
physicists and philosophers have observed that the physics is abstract . 
it 's the structure of the reality of a series of experiments , but they 're not telling us about the reality that lies their . 
as stephen hawking , " what are the going to live ? " 
according to view , you can apply the physics of physics as you are , but you can use it to use the power of the consciousness . 
that 's what the physics is doing the power of consciousness . 
so it 's the conscious that keeps the . 
from this view of consciousness is not beyond the physical world as a kind of extra . 
it 's just in your center . 
i think this view perspective has changed the potential to change our relationship to nature , and it might have some serious social and consequences . 
some of them may not be intuitive . 
i thought i thought , i should n't eat anything that was a consciousness , and therefore . 
if you get rid of the , it 's going to be very hungry . 
i think if you think about it , it 's going to change what it 's going from , and view of , is less the of consciousness , but rather than the scale and the complexity of consciousness . 
it 's also logical , according to the minds in other systems , like example in computers . 
what about the artificial complex system in the movie ? " 
is it consciously ? 
you the , it 's certainly to be a high level , and it 's be the answer . yes , it 's consciously . 
now , if this is really true , serious issues topics , both to the ethics of the developing world as the to . 
finally , you could change the awareness of the , of the planet . 
has a its own consciousness ? 
or on the level , there 's a group of how the audience came out of the audience , we just a , there a movie for this collective framework , which are the from the movies of each of ? 
i do n't know the answer to this question , but i think it should be at least . 
okay , this vision of vision is radical , and i do n't know if you 're right . 
i , i 'm actually very much from the first crazy idea that the consciousness is so much better than the second is that it 's universal . 
this perspective for many questions , a lot of challenges to think , like the individual parts of the consciousness and the and the complexity of the complexity that we know and love . 
when we find that answers , we 'll go back to the right way to a theory of the consciousness . 
if you do n't , it 's be the most important problem in science and philosophy . 
we ca n't expect it to overnight . 
but i think we 're going to solve it . 
i think the understanding of our consciousness is a key understanding the understanding of the universe as well . 
it might just need the right crazy idea . 
thank you very much . 
i grew up in a very small town . 
my childhood is about normal and the . 
i went to school , with friends , friends , with me with my younger sisters . 
it was all normal . 
when i was 15 , i was a project to my parents : the community wanted me to me for an expert for special - . 
my parents said , " well , that 's really nice , but there 's a problem : there 's a problem . 
to be honest , she did n't have anything . " and they right . 
i went to school , i got a high school , helped school a school in my mother , and spent a lot of time , " the , in the of the " and " the <unk> . " 
yeah , i know . what 's a contradiction . 
but they were right . 
years later , while my graduate student in high school high school , after 20 minutes , in the in the , and he said , " when do you start with your speech ? " 
" what ? " i wanted to know . 
i had 20 minutes over the and the and the . 
he said , " you know , know , well , your the . 
when someone in the wheelchair in the wheelchair , this person is mostly stuff . " 
" usually do n't happen in the <unk> . " 
there was a light on me : this young man had people with people with disability with disability more than the . 
so for him , we 're it -- and it does n't mean anything to it . 
for many of these teachers are not teachers , doctors or doctors . 
we are not real people . we should inspire . 
and in fact , i 'm sitting standing here on this stage and i 'm like in the wheelchair in the wheelchair , and you probably kind of like me that i 'm you , right ? right ? yes . 
ladies and gentlemen , i have to make it horrible . 
i 'm not here to inspire them . 
and i 'm going to tell you that we actually start to see when it comes to . 
disability is not bad , and it does n't make us extraordinary . 
in the last few years , we 've been able to spread the in the social media even further . 
you 've probably seen pictures like this : " the only disability in life is a bad attitude . " 
or , " your is your . " 
or : " you know , before you look at ! " 
these are just a few examples ; it 's lots of these images . 
you may probably know that little girl without hands with the pen in the mouth . 
you may have seen the kid that 's on the . 
and these pictures , there are many that we call the . 
i use the word to the word of because , because you can make people in order to make others . 
it 's power to make objects that can benefit . 
these images have the to inspire , so that you look at the , and they thought , " how bad my life is life , it might be worse . 
i could be this person . " 
but what if you 're that person ? 
i 've got to count about how often strangers came to me to tell me that they me , or inspiring , that was a long before my work was publicly . 
in a way , i told you that i woke up in morning , and remember my name . i 'm going to make a human for a object . 
all of these images are making objects for the . 
and are to so that you can use it , it feels better and its own . 
in fact , life is actually quite difficult . 
we 're so much more . 
but what we 're doing is not what they 're doing . 
it has nothing to do with your body . 
i 'm dealing with intent with the issues , because , because i think the social model of disability , we are more by society that we live in than our bodies and . 
i 've been living for long in the body . 
i like him . 
it 's what to do , and i have learned how to use his skills to use as much as it is . it 's also about the children on these photos . 
they do n't do anything . 
they just use their bodies , so good as possible . 
is it really fair to how to make objects and like these pictures are taken ? 
when people say , " they are a inspiration , they want to make a . 
i know why . 
because of the that us was that disability has extraordinary . 
i 'm thinking about inspiration , inspiration , and you think , " man , the , do you never have anything ? " 
yes , yes . yes . yes . 
i 'm constantly by other . 
but i do n't learn that i 'm more lucky than you . 
i think that it 's a great idea to start with a the - scale stuff , and i 'm going to make the that 's cell phone with the battery with the battery of the battery . 
brilliant ! 
we 're learning from the strength and emotion of others , not in fight against our bodies and , rather than a world that makes us feel special . 
in my opinion , this is a about a disability . 
it makes us alive . 
and the quote " the only living in life is a bad attitude , it 's great the because it 's not true because of social . 
you can climb the staircase for a long time , they do n't turn into a . 
it 's never going to happen . 
i want to live in a world where which is the norm is norm . 
in the a girl who in her room in the room -- in the west of the of the , not as the as , because they 're sitting in the seats . 
i want to live in a world where you do n't expect enough to expect you expect them to stand up and stand up in the morning . 
i want to live in a world where the ultimate performance is the , ; i want to live in a world where a student of class , class in class , do n't want his new teacher in the wheelchair . 
not does n't make us to tell us , but the of our attitude . 
thank you . 
what 's " to do with empathy ? 
how fast is " the " the in the air ? 
unfortunately , i 'm just going to answer just one of these questions today , please do n't want to . 
most people think at the reality of " the , " tom , like tom in the air , but he 's not fiction . 
he 's something that faster than we think , to our lifetime , and it will come , because we have the technologies , and you have to be aware of it , because it will change our lives , just like the internet and the cell . 
and how do we get it ? 
so the first step for success is i 'm just google to google . 
many of you know google . 
you may not know that google is a device that allows you to see what i see . 
and to experience , it 's like the standing on the field . 
right now , if you can experience it , if i it you . 
i have to say it in words . 
i have to create a framework that they 're with their imagination . 
with google , we can put this under a helmet , and a feeling sense of how it is to with the field of the field , and your body on the body . 
you can see what it is , when a the on them , and you 're trying to use it with . 
i 've self that self , and it does n't feel well . 
here 's the video . 
go . 
<unk> , being the , is the . 
wait , i 'm going to go . 
are you ready ? 
go ! 
you 've sure that there are people : the rest of the team . 
we 've got a video from the washington . 
<unk> : hey , the <unk> ! the ! 
blue ! 
oh ! 
fans want to experience this experience , experience 
want on the field . 
you want to be your , and you 've got to youtube and twitter on twitter , " you can you give you a the ? 
once we have that experience , with google and google , how do we make it better ? 
what is the next step ? 
in the end , as one of the most the - ever time of all time , and it 's not just a . 
and i can show you with this video why this is so . 
oh ! oh ! oh ! oh ! oh ! 
no ! no ! no ! i do n't want anymore ! no ! no ! no ! 
oh my god ! the ! 
this is a man a - and . 
how will it be for him when he the with over 100 miles over 100 miles ? 
i think adults will be again . 
but this is not yet . 
this is just virtual reality . 
how do we come to ? 
we can do that , if coaches , managers and owners these information , and ask yourself , " how do we deal with that team ? 
how can we win with games ? " 
teams use technologies to win games . 
they 're like to make that . 
a short story of the technologies in technology . 
now , the have the <unk> of their to a with him faster . 
they won the <unk> . 
other teams followed . 
more people , because the games is the games . 
there was exciting and faster . 
in 1994 , the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , who were also the . 
more people saw the games were going to be . 
and the . 
imagine in front of play , play with them . you walk go back to the <unk> , and you see the next on the front on front of your day , which they 're wearing today . 
no longer more afraid of the . 
no need to be able to learn all sorts of need . 
they go out there and react . 
and the want to that because of instructions , you feel games , and do n't lose . 
then they 're going to be able . 
they do n't want to . 
but it 's not just a the <unk> . 
it allows you to do all of these data in real time and to improve your game . 
how does that look like ? 
a very simple easy , a camera would be a camera on the corner of the corner that all the people below the . 
they also have the data from the <unk> and the <unk> , technologies that are working on right now . 
they 've learned all these data to their . 
the good teams data . 
the bad news is a . 
the good and bad teams . 
and now your is as important as her as is , and the is not just for . 
it was for malaria . who would have thought ? 
how would it be on the field ? 
imagine think they 're the . 
they get the ball . 
they 're looking for a free . 
suddenly , a on the left will come back on your and show you that the blind comes to the <unk> . " 
typically , they do n't see him , but he 's the player with this . 
they 're in position . 
another lightning for a . 
they 're , but they 're hit . 
the ball is no control , control , control . 
you do n't know where he 's . 
but on the of the water , it 's the , and it can react . 
he can catch the ball , go off , the . 
the amount of the , and the fans is time with him , and from any perspective . 
this will be a new desire for the game . 
people will be in , because they want to experience this experience . 
fans wants to be on the field . 
you want to be your the . 
it 's going to be part of the because , because it does n't do it . 
but my question is , is : are we happy to do it ? 
do we want it for bread and games , ordinary ? 
i think that is that we can use it for more . 
and i think we can use the ways to make the empathy to the people , by telling someone who 's someone to someone else in other . 
we know what this technology is worth value . 
they invest birth in the . 
what 's this technology a in uganda or russia , the world , among what conditions is it ? 
what is this technology - industrial technology , or the - worth - worth value , who 's a generation of children to think about all and science and not about the and the ? 
ladies and gentlemen , the become reality . 
the questions that we make the choices that we are facing challenges are facing are facing , in our hand . 
thank you very much . 
i was recently after 23 years from the service in the california . 
most of the time spent this 23 years , i spent as a the at the <unk> of the county , which is also the blue lies . 
the bridge is a the hall , the globe around the world is beautiful in san francisco , the pacific ocean and its architecture . 
unfortunately , it 's a sense for suicide , because of the world around the world are most places . 
the blue level has been called the . 
joseph the , the <unk> engineer , in the words of the , " the bridge is the <unk> . 
suicide is based on the bridge is neither nor . " 
but since then , of course , there was more than 600 people from this bridge in death . 
some people believe that one person between two the into a different dimension -- the bridge has been the -- that by the case of all , and everything else , and , and the water is down in the soul . 
i 'm going to tell you what really happens when the bridge used to be used . 
in the , the bones , which some of organs . 
most of the die . 
those of those who do n't die , mostly in the water , and then there . 
i do n't think that the way that i think of this kind of the , is what it 's going to be . 
this is the cable . 
aside from the area around the two were going on top of the side of the bridge . 
this is where most people before they take the life . 
from experience , i can tell you that one person who already on the , and your in your , just very hard . 
i took this photograph last year when this young woman spoke with a woman and talked about her life . 
and i 'm very happy to tell you that we were successful day , they had to go on the other side of the . 
when i started working on the bridge , there was no training . 
you 've lost his way through the . 
this was not just a the for , but also for the . 
since then we have a long way behind us . 
today , the policemen and the new . 
this is jason the . 
i graduated up last year last year , july met , and when i call a call , it was a the <unk> , which was about in the middle of the bridge in the cable . 
i answered and , and when i arrived , i watched watching him with a newspaper of the newspaper . 
it was just 32 years old , and is from new jersey . 
after we talked about an hour at the same time , he asked us if we know the story of the . 
so let 's look at the , the and , and them down to the earth , and she said , " never seen this . " 
and one day when the curiosity was , she opened the . 
they came to , and all kinds of researchers who were about the . 
the good thing in the was hope . 
and then we asked us , " what happens when you remove the , you do n't have hope ? " 
he was quiet for a moment , right to the right , and was gone . 
these nice intelligent young man from new jersey had taken to life . 
i talked to the last night with my parents and i think when i was talking to them , i did n't feel very well , because on the next day , the of the family to me to me . 
parents had asked him . 
the of a car is so many people . 
i 'll tell you the following : what would you do if a member , a friend or a blind person would be ? 
what would you say ? 
would you know what you should say ? 
my experience is this is not just about talking about it , but to listen to the listening . 
listen to understand . 
do n't , they do n't do , or do n't tell the other person you know how they feel feels because they do n't know . 
just simply there , you might have the idea that has the person . 
if you think that somebody is the , they do n't fear afraid of this person . 
you might say , for example , ask yourself , " other people in situations , are thinking about how to live your life , you know ? " 
the person in order to save , maybe save her lives , and it 's turning to . 
other signs that you should look at the is that the things are bad , and never better ; the belief that you think you ca n't do about it ; it takes away from the social life and the loss of life . 
i 've just talk this talk before few days ago , and i have a email from a lady that i 'd like to you . 
she had her son at january , january year , and she wrote me this email just a few days ago , and with her permission and her i read them . 
" hi kevin , probably right on the ted . 
this has to be a great experience . 
i think i should go this weekend on the bridge . 
i wanted to give you a couple of lines . 
and i hope that there 's a lot of people with their message , and they go home and talk with their friends that they tell their friends their friends . 
i 'm still quite , but more and more moments that i realize that mike is not coming home . 
mike is from san francisco to san francisco , at the 19th january with his father the game of the . 
he never there . 
i put the police in the <unk> , and it him to night . 
in the next morning , two students came home to me home and told me that my car was driving at the bottom of the bridge . 
a saw , as he was working on the day at night a.m. by the bridge . 
so thank you very much for you might be to be for those who might be the to be themselves to be themselves . 
no one did n't even know , without having a mental illness ? 
it should n't be so easy to change your own life . 
i 'm for them and the fight they fight fighting fight . 
the <unk> , a the , should be a transition about our bay , and no one . 
much more lucky this week , the . " 
i ca n't imagine how much courage it has to go to bridge and go to the way that son of the day , and did n't think it needs to . 
i 'd like to introduce you a man who hope for me hope and courage . 
on march , in 2005 , i was a in a the . 
and i went along with my fortune through the <unk> , and this guy man , kevin the , he stood on the <unk> . 
and for the next half hours , i was talking to him about his depression and his the . 
kevin on the day from the day to go back to the , and his life to another chance . 
as a kevin the , i the him . 
" this is a new beginning , new life . " 
but i asked him , " what exactly to go back to the and hope there 's another chance ? " 
and you know what he told me ? 
he said , " you 've got to see me . 
you 've got to talk me , and you 've just about it . " 
shortly after this event , i got a letter from the mother , and i got it here , and i 'd like to read you . 
" the mr. the , nothing can get off the 11 , march , march , but , but they are one of the reasons why the reason are the us . 
i believe that kevin moved out of aid . 
for him , there was a mental disease that he had to get the medicine . 
i 've , i 've been talking about six months , completely the about any of features , but thank god , thank you now . 
kevin all about how he says . 
we thank god for them . 
deep within her fault , the <unk> . " 
and at the end of her , she said , " the , when i went to the san francisco at night . they were as a . 
boy , i had to go back to . " 
today , a is a father and a third member of society . 
he speaks talking about the politicians , and , and his depression in the hope that his story is inspired . 
suicide is not just in the profession . 
in the personal environment . 
my grandfather has taken life through life . life . 
this fact , even though they had his own pain , i gave me the chance to meet him ever . 
the suicide . 
most people or people who are thinking about suicide , would never think of thinking another people . 
they only want you to change your pain . 
that 's usually normally in one of three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol , or death . 
in my career , i 've worked on hundreds of , and i 've been hundreds of cases of mental illness , and more and around the bridge . 
in the <unk> where i 've been involved in , i only lost two people , but that 's two too many . 
one of them was free . 
the other was a man that i spoke about an hour . 
and he had three times my hand . 
at the last the , he looked at me , and he said , " kevin , i 'm sorry , but i have to go . " 
and he 's . 
what i want to tell you about is that most of the people we come up with the bridge , no suicide . 
in fact , most of the people who are and talk about it , one or two or two percent people have said that they were in the moment , they knew they had a mistake , and they wanted to live . 
i 'm telling the people that the bridge is not just the and san francisco , but they also people . 
the connection , or the bridge that we 're doing is something that every single of us . 
suicide is . 
there are help . there are hope . 
thank you very much . 
the world makes you something that you 're not , but you yourself , you 're , and you ask your question in your heart : " how are you going to get this ? " 
i 'm perhaps something special , but i 'm not alone , and all alone . 
when i was developed , it was like as the dream that i had been since my finally . 
my self - finally with my inner truth , my inner self . 
the reasons for reasons is that -- that 's why i come back later -- but at the end of this , it 's like at the point , like , " the , that 's it ! you 've done it . " 
but last october , i realized that i was just at the beginning . 
we all be in the , from our families , from our religion , from our society , from the time we live in , even our own bodies . 
some people have courage to courage themselves not to accept the individual that accept their skin , or the of their . 
these people are always a threat for the status quo of what 's as . 
in my case , during the last nine years , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , my friends , even my did n't know about my story . 
when i was five years old , i was looking at the same time that i kept on my head on my head . 
my mom asked me , " why do you always keep this shirt on your head ? " 
i said , " the , these are my hair . i 'm a girl . " 
i knew my own identity . 
gender has always been seen in fact , the , but now we know that it 's unique , and . 
because of my mind , i never had the courage to tell my story , not because i thought that 's not something wrong with me , but because of the way that the world of us who are treated . 
every day , i 'm so grateful because i am a woman . 
i have a mother , a father and a family who me how i am . 
many are not so lucky . 
in asia , there 's a old tradition in the gender . 
there 's a long of compassion . 
there is a the , a the . 
when i was eight years old , i was in a the on the of the . 
i stood standing in front of the stage , and i know , this woman came out here , right , front of me , and at that moment , i knew this kind of woman i wanted to be . 
when i was 15 years old , it was still as young , i met a woman called the woman . 
it was the for the . 
at this evening , she asked me , " why do n't you go to mit ? " 
that moment changed my life . 
suddenly , i found myself in the world . 
there were n't a lot of people in the first job in the , but i told me . 
at the age of 15 and 17 years ago , i was in the with mit , which was literally put up in a truck , or sometimes it was the next to a the , and when it rains -- the amount of things -- they were
i also the of strangers , especially in the provinces in the philippines . 
but most importantly , i was some of some of my best friends in this community . 
in 2001 , my mom came out of san francisco , and told me that my colleague had been used for a green the <unk> that i could now in the united states . 
i 'm against myself . 
i said to her , " the , i have fun . 
i 'm here friends , i love to travel and travel . 
two weeks later , she looked at her , and she said , " did you know that you to a in the united states and your gender ? " 
i do n't have to hear . 
my mother also said , i should write my name with two words . " 
and she was me when i was in surgery , i had surgery . 
it 's interesting that in the areas , some of the military , the and the surgeries . 
at the time , in the united states , to take surgery before you could write his names and his gender . 
so in 2001 , i went to san francisco , and i know , when i when i was my , when i came to my with my name and the <unk> . 
this was a moment . 
for some people , this person is a license to a , or for the , alcohol , but for me , it was to my life and dignity . 
i believed to create my dream , new york could be . 
many are not so lucky . 
i think thinking about a woman named the <unk> . 
she 's from new york , a young woman who wants to her truth , but there 's a chance to live their lives . 
for most of my background , the reality that we live in . 
our high - is so high as much as the population is population . 
every year on the 20th century , we a global response to the memory of memory . 
i 'm standing here on this stage , because there 's a long story of people who spread around and against injustice . 
these are the perfect johnson and sylvia the . 
today , right now right now , my real life . 
i could n't make my truth for myself . 
i want to help my best to help their brains without fear and fear . 
i 'm myself here , it 's not going to be more anymore , on the 20 , november a . 
my the truth , allowed me to accept me how i am . 
can you do that ? 
thank you very much . 
i wish i 'd like to say what you say to say , but also in other friends , to families and all of those who are people who have trouble with the gender , and what would you say to the people of people ,
sure . sure : i have a lucky . 
and sometimes it does , sometimes , so -- it 's just the that the identity in the core of , right ? 
all of us in the birth of the , and i 'm trying to talk a conversation about the gender , and , and that you should give people the people to your identity , and that conversation should we need to deal with
the is the at the at the beginning , in the beginning of the <unk> and the . 
there 's a lot to do . 
it should be insight . 
it should be room for curiosity , for questions , and i hope you 're all here . 
thank you very much . that was beautiful . thank you . 
in many societies and societies are fathers , by their sons , but i am one of the few of who known his daughter , and i 'm proud of it . 
in fact , she was her daughter , but now i am her father . 
ladies and gentlemen , if we look at the history of mankind , is the story of women a story full of injustice , inequality , violence and violence . 
she wo n't be welcome , neither from your father of her mother . 
the neighborhood comes over the mother to mother , and no one father the father . 
a mother feels a very feel when she got a girl . 
if you get the first girl to the world , the first daughter , she 's sad . 
if you take the second daughter to the world , she 's shocked and in a son of son , the birth of the third daughter , she feels her like a great . 
not just the mother , but also the daughter , daughter 's daughter , when those older , they 're also . 
with five , in a age where you should go to school , she 's home to her home her school in school . 
by the age of 12 , she has sort of good life . 
they can have fun . 
she can play with your friends on the street , and it can be freely into a like a . 
but as a child , with 13 years , it 's going to be without male from the house . 
it 's in the four of your own the . 
it 's not longer a human . 
she 's going to honor to her father , her brothers and her family , and if she 's the difference , she can even be killed . 
and what 's interesting is interesting is that this is not just the life of life itself , but also the of the . 
i know a family with seven sisters and a brother , and this brother is the to the of his sisters and his parents , because he thinks that if seven sisters would take a profession and out of the house to make a
this brother , so , the joy in his life and his happiness his life on the of the . 
there 's another important of the most societies , and that 's a . 
a good girl has to be very , very and very . 
this is the <unk> . 
the good - old good has to be very quiet . 
they should be very the , and they should leave the decisions of their father and her mother , and the choices of older , even if they were this . 
otherwise , it will be considered as a . 
and what happens at the end ? 
in the words of a race , it will give you and , and then to make another and daughters . 
and this cycle continues . 
and gentlemen , these millions of millions of women could be changed , if women and men , men and women and societies in the developing world , some of the families and families society , and they the laws in the systems in the in the
brothers and sisters , when the was born when i first for the first time , you know , i like , honestly , i do n't know -- when i first her to the eyes , i believe it was me . 
long before they were born , i was thinking about their name , and was fascinated by the <unk> , afghanistan . 
her name was the of the , and i used to daughter her daughter . 
some days after birth , after my daughter , my cousin came over -- and this was a chance -- he came home to me and brought home with a family of the family , and when i met this , he was 300 years to
and as i met him -- all of these men were men -- i took my pen , i took a line from my name and wrote " the . " 
when she was older , a half years ago , i took them into my school . 
now , ask you why should i say that a girl in a school in a school ? 
yeah , i have to mention it . 
this may be perhaps as granted in canada , in the u.s. states and many other countries , but in poor countries , in societies , in societies , it 's a great event for the life of life . 
to go to school , your identity and your . 
to go to school , that they want to go into the world of their dreams and their hopes , where they their talents for her life . 
i have five sisters , and none of them could go to school . it 's going to take it , but two weeks ago , when i was this for the <unk> , and i pulled the over the family , i did n't
and the reason for that was that i never seen the names of my sisters . 
what my father could n't sisters my sisters could not able to do his own i had to change my opinion . 
i 've always been the intelligence and the daughter of my daughter . 
i gave them encouraged to me to me when my friends came to visit me . 
i 've encouraged them to visit me with different . 
and all of these good values tried to in their personality . 
and that was not just for them , not just the . 
i have these good values in my school , both with both with students . 
i 've been education for the . 
i brought my girls , i brought my to the lesson of the . 
i brought my students to the lesson of the . 
brothers and sisters , we the for more for women for women , and we 're giving them more and more and more space for women in society . 
but we 're talking about a new phenomenon . 
something more important for human rights , and especially for practice . 
it 's called the . 
this is the prime of the participation of women in all political , economic and social activity . 
hundreds of schools are lost . 
girls , it was banned to go to school . 
women were forced to wear homes , and they were happy to go to markets . 
musicians were sent to silence and girls and killed . 
millions of people , but just a few things , and it 's very the to for your own rights , if you 're surrounded by people who are killing and kill and kill . 
it 's really the most thing . 
at the age of 10 years , stood up and stood on her right to education . 
she wrote a journal for a the , she worked working on for the front of the new york times , and she spoke to each other . 
and her voice was voice . voice . 
they spread like a " the " all around the world . 
and that was the reason why the taliban were able to get their campaign , and at the end of october , 2012 , it was made out of the distance in the head . 
it was the day of the day of my family and my family . 
the world became a big black hole . 
while my daughter live in my life and death the , i am my wife to her ear , " am i blame , what am my daughter and daughter ? " 
and she immediately , " please do n't blame . 
you 're right for the right thing . 
you 've your lives on the , for the truth , for the truth , for peace , and for education , and your daughter was inspired by her and you . 
you 're both the on the right and god will protect it . " 
those few words are a very , for me , and i did that question . 
whereas during the hospital in the hospital , pain , strong the , because her the became the , i saw a dark shadow on the face of my wife . 
but my daughter is never . 
she always said to us , " my favorite smile is okay , and my in my face in the face . 
i 'm going to go . please do n't . " 
it was a us for us , and she gave us . 
brothers sisters , we learned from the , in the times , and i 'm happy to share with you with them , even though they 're a for the children of children and women , it 's like any other the . 
they 're wrong , when their homework are not completely . 
they the <unk> with her , which i 'm very happy . 
people ask me what the particular thing about me than me , which has made so the <unk> , and so and so forth and so forth . 
and i 'm tell you , do n't ask me what i did . 
ask me what i did not done . 
i do n't have their wings . this is all . 
thank you very much . 
18 years ago , i was the on the brain , and it 's been an passion for me . 
i 'm actually the . 
anyway , after a , a . 
am i not even nor or not ? 
and if you ca n't , can i get it again ? 
and after my surgery , i had to take how many of from a dozen of chemicals , i lost every day , and i just did n't know , i would have lost less hours . 
there was a couple of times it was really . 
but luckily , i love experiments , and through , and so i decided to experiment to experiment to find the <unk> , because there 's no in this area that would have enough . 
i tried a lot of the , and it took me to the of the , like the changes of the , my sense , my sense of myself , my thinking , to change my behavior . other people . 
a particularly wonderful case , a couple of months , i actually the and chemicals that had a man for a man in the early , and i could n't believe how my thoughts my mind . 
i was quite extremely . 
but i 'm surprised that i was n't trying to be compassionate . 
i was actually trying to get a little bit and the , the problem with me , and it was n't like that . 
but i think , thanks to this experience a better understanding for men , and for what they need to do , and since i 've gotten much better with men . 
i wanted to reach one of the of the and so on , to my disease , and i wanted to intelligence my intelligence , my thinking , my . 
i think mostly in , and so i became that for me to me -- how do i think these images that i like to sort of kind of representation for my ideas , if you 're trying to test different ideas to different
this kind of thinking is not new . 
philosophers like the , the and the saw it . 
they thought , pictures and ideas are actually the same . 
today 's going to be today by many of and how our head is actually going to be positive , but for me , it 's very simple : mental images , most of us are essential for the and creative . 
so , after , after several years ago , i finally , and now i see a lot of great , very high - looking images at the level and the . 
now , i 'm working on how to these images from my heads . my computer . 
imagine , imagine an the would be to be with imagination . 
or a musician could write his music from his . 
this provides an incredible opportunity of how creative people can be in the . 
and i want to show you why i think we are close to this . there are two days in two groups of two groups in neuroscience . 
both the <unk> -- functional the -- to the brain , and you 're seeing a the of the <unk> and colleagues in harvard . 
the left shows the person of a person who look at a picture . 
the middle of the sun shows a same person who is just looking at the image . 
and the right ended up through the of the off of the left , and it shows that the difference is almost zero to zero . 
it 's been in many different people , with lots of different images , always with a similar . 
there 's no such as any difference between the actual front of the image and the <unk> picture . the same picture . 
let me show you next experiment that jack of the <unk> at the berkeley . 
in this experiment , the hundreds of hours of video videos , while they were made by their brains , and created a created the that created the reactions that the reactions to the . 
and then a new movie was shown , with new images , new people , new animals , and new the was recorded . 
the computer , just the of the , the new and showed what he thought he was actually the person . 
on the right hand side of the right on the side of the computer , and on the left side the . 
that 's where the language is . 
we are so close . 
we just need to improve the resolution . 
and do n't forget that if you see an image , and if you imagine to see the same picture of you see exactly the same thing . 
so this has been done with the highest resolution of today , and , and the industry has actually improved in the last few years . 
the next thing we need to do is even more used to get to . 
how do we do that ? 
there are many different ways for this approach . 
it was a way to protect the skull and electrodes . 
that 's nothing for me . 
there will be a lot of new the , even some of me , but given the successes , we have to ask ourselves whether we have at the end of this technology . 
but what conventional experience is that the can only become more likely to become human , but at the point of the time , not just as important , not as much as we need . 
what i 'm suggesting is : instead rather than instead of , we need better . 
and we can make a lot of very complex structures to easily with various different , a little bit like a the . 
so , why is that important ? 
in the last years , you know , in the in the , it 's really hard . 
but most of the great progress in the resolution was actually built by the , and in and the in the . 
so what we need to do is that we , we , pattern , pattern , instead of one of the , to add the . 
so 's how we can thanks to the combination of this dynamic pattern with the sensory of information from a single . 
when we use , we should be able to use it , not just the flow of blood flow , but also from of and , as already , and perhaps even the to measure what the goal is . 
we will be able to understand our ideas directly on the digital media . 
can you imagine language and directly with human thoughts ? 
what would we be able ? 
and how are we going to learn to deal with the truths of human ? 
they think the internet is big . 
these are pretty big questions . 
it may be more powerful than the instrument that our thinking and our . 
and this instrument could be led to cure with disease and diseases . 
we have no choice to open that door . 
it 's hard to realize that it 's going to be longer . 
we need to learn to make this step together . 
thank you . 
i think we 're all . 
her can be able to tell someone for the first time to say her , or tell you that they pregnant , or someone to say that they have cancer , or one of the other people that we live in our lives . 
so , after the , the conversation is always difficult , and even though the topics are very different very different , the experience is to have a secret to and to . 
it 's scary , and we hate it . it has to be done . 
several years ago , i was working in the national cafe in the south line , in the city , and during my time , i went through the <unk> strength : no the of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> . 
and depending on , like " the <unk> , and how quickly my hair had just been me , i often asked me the question , usually , a little kid : " do you have a boy or a girl ? " girl ? " 
and then at the table , they found a radical silence . 
i put my teeth a little bit , and i my with a little bit more . 
the father 's his in his newspaper , and the mother her mother to her head . 
but i did n't , and i . 
so i promised myself that i was going to say anything . 
i would going to make this conversation . 
so after a few weeks , it was back . 
" are you a boy or a girl ? " 
i have my horrible the quotes . 
i fact , i actually have a little excerpt from " the <unk> . " 
so i deep , and look down , and look at a the girl in a pink , no challenge to a the , just a child with a question : " are you a boy or a girl ? " girl ? "
so i 'm going through the deep , and me to me , and say , " hey , i know , it 's something confusing . 
my hair are so close to like a young , and i 'm wearing the , but i 'm a girl , and you know how sometimes you want to play a pink , and how do you prefer rather than your instead ? 
so , i 'm more of the <unk> . " 
and this kid look at me straight into the eyes without the , and says , " my favorite is purple with fish . 
can i have a the ? " 
how about it the ? " 
this was the most difficult conversation that i 've ever . 
and why ? because the <unk> , and i was the . 
how many of us had a couple of secrets in my life , and yes , mostly it 's that i am . 
but you do n't see the people on what they 're carrying with . 
you just know how it feels like a secret . 
so my secret is not from your or your . 
surely , i 'm going to give you an reasons why my favorite harder was more than her , but it 's all about : hard is not relatively . 
hard is hard . 
who says that it 's harder to tell someone to you that you have the to someone than someone to you ? 
who says that his the is harder when your child is telling you that you 're going to be ? 
there 's no harder , there 's only hard . 
we need to stop with our own dealing with others , only us with better or better or better , or we should we have compassion because we have all hard . 
at a certain point in our lives , we have all sorts of secrets , and they give us security , or at least more security than what might happen if we them . 
but i 'm here to tell you that , regardless of what your secret is , you should not wear with it . 
i was wearing a the , a dress , and the . 
i was n't the <unk> , which was willing to fight with nine cancer who came to the cafe . 
i was scared of fear , was the in the corner , with my dark and my breath , and to move a muscle , is the most exciting thing that i had ever done . 
my family , my friends , completely strangers -- i had spent my whole my whole life to try to try these people , and i the world 's head on the head . 
i used to take the pages of the that we were all for long , but if they do n't get these the , they will kill them . 
one of my favorite the was at the wedding of my sister . 
and after a little bit , a woman called a woman , " i love nathan ! " 
and it started with battle . 
" the , you ever in this ? " 
" well , we 've actually got friends in san francisco . " 
" we never been there , but we heard that it should be the . " 
" the , do you want to be my ? 
he 's really good , and he 's never got a friend . " 
" the , what do you want to do ? 
our favorite ? our favorite : wants and want . 
and you know who we love ? jack . jack . 
jack is our favorite . " 
and then a woman , but desperately to give me their support , and let me tell you that my on my side , she 'd finally out of her , " so my husband is wearing a . " 
i could go to my friend and my table and make me about funny reactions , their to the of political , and i that it was perhaps one of the most things that they were , and the conversation
sure , it would have been able to show your fingers on your the . 
it 's much harder to you , where you 're just right now and the fact that you have yourself . 
and what can you choose to somebody else , except it ? 
when you start to somebody to somebody , you must be willing to get your back . 
heavy conversations are still not even my strength . 
ask you every one i 've ever . 
but i 'm going better , and i 'll like to call it , the three . 
if you look at this the , but you know , it 's always difficult to be his secret . 
number one : they 're authentic . 
take the tank . you yourself . 
no child at the cafe in the cafe , but i was the . 
if you want somebody to be honest , he has to know that they suffer suffering . 
number two : you 're right . just it . you pull it off the . 
if you know that they 're , they just say it . 
when you say your parents , they 're willing to be , will hope that this changes . 
do n't give them the wrong of a false hope . 
they talk to their own truth . 
excuse never . 
and in that way , some people might hurt , surely , they 'd be interested for what they 've done , but they never thought of what they are . 
and yes , some might be may be disappointed , but that 's their problem , not yours . 
these are their expectations of who they are , not their . 
this is their story , not their . 
the only story that counts is that they want to write . 
so , if you look at the picture of your secret , and you feel the <unk> , you think that we all know how it is . 
they may feel very , but they 're not . 
we know that it 's hard , but you have to open up , no matter what your secret is that there are a lot of other , to the next to give a door , so they 're telling this person , and they tell the
intelligence -- what is that ? 
if we had looked like intelligence , it was the famous quote by the <unk> , " the question , whether a machine can be like interesting as if a can swim . " 
as a the <unk> wrote this , he wanted to press the early press of the books , like for example , alan . 
but if we look back , and we think about what , what we 've been to most of the building machines , building machines and building and building , we see that it 's just understanding the understanding of the physical mechanism and the to build these machines .
and so , years ago , years ago , trying to understand the physical of the intelligence . 
let 's go back to take a step back . 
and start with a start . 
let 's imagine if we were n't know that there 's nothing about biology , or intelligence , but that telescopes that we can observe the earth , and an amazing long , that we can see the earth over millions of millions , even billions of years
there 's a very effect , that 's a very effect . 
in fact that the earth has gone from the to a point , and at the point of the , 2000 , on earth on the earth , otherwise would otherwise would be treated or the , before they get the earth .
we know , as a , of course , we know the reason that we 're trying to save ourselves . 
we 're trying to avoid a . 
but if you had a thing that none of nothing does n't know any idea of intelligence , you would have to have a theory , that asteroids that to the surface of the surface the surface of the planet , do n't do more .
what i 'm saying is that the same question is the question of the physical nature of intelligence . 
so i 've been trying to do that in a few years ago , lots of different topics , different areas , which i think , all one on one , intelligence . 
so with the knowledge from all these different kinds of different , i 've been asked me if there is one of the intelligence mechanism that we can from all of these the ? 
is there a single equation for intelligence ? 
and the answer , i think , yes . " t the <unk> . " and what you 're seeing is probably the best the to e - for intelligence that i 've seen . 
what you 're seeing here is an statement of an illusion that intelligence is a force that so that the future is going to be the future . 
it 's so that the future is going to be , or an open , with a strength with the <unk> of the to , to a future . 
in short , i do n't like to get into a trap . 
intelligence is trying to maximize the future and open and open . 
now , with that equation , it 's , of course , what can we do with this ? 
what can you make it predictions ? 
it 's human intelligence ? 
do it artificial intelligence ? 
now , i 'm going to show you a video that i think , some of the most powerful applications of this equation . 
but what if these the - connection between intelligence and intelligence on a fundamental context ? 
what if intelligent behavior does not only with the production of entropy , but it 's actually going to come from ? 
in order to figure out what we 've got to call a , a is a is called " the , which is to increase the production of entropy of every single system . 
there 's a lot a lot of the , games play games , and even money with money , zero . 
here are some examples of the in action . 
as a person looks like , without the , and we can see here in a on a car on a car . 
this behavior remarkable , because we 've never have a target . 
she just to the . 
this ability to play this , will be used for robotics and technical . 
so in some of the animals objects in their environment , using in rooms , it 's been able to go back into a , so that a small tool into a small space that has a third , and , and the third of
this ability is going to find more popular and the and agriculture . 
also , as some of animals , by at the end of the end of the end of a to food , we 'll see that there is something that creates it in this model . 
this has interesting implications for many , and many lot of other . 
<unk> can be applied on a variety of areas . 
and this is where you can see successful versus against itself , what you see in your play . 
this is what we 're seeing here is how to create new connections in social networks , and friends , again , they lose the to win the network . 
the same capacity of the has also application in energy , energy and intelligence . 
and what we see seeing here is , as you see a massive , the , and used to their range from the atlantic into the pacific . 
in the same reason , it 's based on the problems of problems in central - scale and scale and transportation . 
in the end , what we can see here is like a cheap , expensive the at the end of a massive the and , and the of the . 
and this ability to the capacity is being used in and . 
alex the : we 've just seen that a variety of cognitive , like the , the and , and social cooperation , all of a single equation that makes a system that makes a system to maximize its future . 
this leads to a deep . 
when we go back to the beginning of the first robot , the game , and then it would be the concept that if we had an intelligence , it 's a the . 
the machines would turn against us . 
so an important lesson from that work is that maybe we 've been seen the concept of the concept . 
machines are n't getting intelligent , and then the and try to make the world . 
another important thing is the <unk> . 
i 'm going to ask how the ability to accept goals , out of this ? 
and finally , richard feynman , physicists , that if the human civilization would be to be able to support the , that all of us are out of tiny elements , when they 're far away , but when they 're close together . 
so my favorite of this statement is a to the intelligence of intelligence , or to help them understand human intelligence is that should be seen as a as a process of being able to future the future and the future of the future . 
thank you very much .
