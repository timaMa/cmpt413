when i was in my 20s , i had my first the . 
i was a , and i studied in berkeley . berkeley . 
she was a woman named alex . 
as soon as the first arrived came , she came up , and she was a , and she fell into my office in my office , the her , and she told me to talk about the . 
and when i heard this , i was the . 
i mean , my the had a patient as a first patient . 
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about . 
i 'll leave it , i thought . 
but i did n't have it . 
with the stories , the alex came into the , it was easy to me , just to deal with head , as we faced the problems . 
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , they had right . 
work came later , later came later , later came later , later came later . 
people in the , like alex , and i did n't have time . 
but soon , my , my god was asking in question . 
i was holding . 
i said , " yeah , yeah , you 'll be close with your , you with a , but she 's not going to marry it . " 
and he said , " well , " not yet , but maybe you 'll save the next . 
another thing is the best time on alex to work before they married . " 
this is what psychologists call a the . 
that was the moment when i realized that 30 was not the new 20 . 
yes , people used to look at the times , but did n't mean any of the . 
and this was alex at the moment of the , and we sat there , and we sat there . 
and then i realized that this kind of the <unk> was a serious problem with real consequences , just for alex and their the , but for the , and families of all the people in the . 
at that moment , in the united states , 50 million people in the . 
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you 're not going to achieve the without to go through the . 
thank you guys when you 're in your . 
i want to do a couple of you . 
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible . 
if you work with somebody in the , one loves , because of the in the , i 'd like to see you -- . people in the really are really important . 
my are people in the , because i believe that every one of these 50 million should know what psychologists , and wisdom , is one of the most and most things you can do for the work for the , for happiness ,
this is not my opinion . that 's facts . 
we know that 80 percent of the <unk> moments are going to happen to 35 . 
that means that eight of 10 decisions , experiences and experiences that make out of your life , which make it , until you 're going to be . 
do n't want the if you 're talking about 40 . 
this group is going to be fine , i think . 
now , we know that the first 10 years of a is a tremendous impact on how much money is going to deserve . 
we know that more than more than half of americans are married or with the future partner or partner . 
we know that the brain is going to be and big grow in the , and for the , which means whatever you want to look at the time to do this . 
we know that the citizens are during the more than the same time in the life and the of the women with their peak and after 35 are 35 . 
so in the ' , you should be the across the body and the your possibilities . 
when we think about the development of a child , we know all know that the first five years for drugs and are in the brain . 
it 's the time when the ordinary , life has a impact on the future . 
but we hear about little bit about there , there 's something like , and our time are a time . 
but the people do n't hear in the . 
the press talking about the <unk> of the <unk> . 
scientists call the hackers of a . 
journalists is the stupid of people in the , like " the " or " the . " 
that 's true . 
so as a culture , we have the what 's now the decade for the food . 
<unk> meant that big things with a plan and a little bit of time . 
is n't that ? 
so what happens when you put someone in the ' head , and say , " you , you know , you get 10 years to make some of your life ? " 
nothing . 
this person is the <unk> , and the and it 's not nothing . 
and so every day , interesting people in the people like your sons and daughters into my office and say something like me , " i do n't know my friend does n't know , but this relationship is not . i 'm just the time . "
or you say , " all say , as long as i 've done it for 30 years , it 's all fine . " 
but later , it sounds like , " my is almost , and i did n't have anything . 
i had a better fortune when i had finished the college . " 
and then it sounds like , " in my 20s , the like the journey . jerusalem . jerusalem . 
all the <unk> and they had fun , but then with 30 , the music came out of and everybody began to . 
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed , and i sometimes , i did my husband , because he was in my in the my chair . " chair . " 
where are the people in the in here ? 
does n't do that . 
ok , that 's easy to say , but it does n't mistake , because it 's about much . 
if a lot of things down into the , there 's a enormous pressure to go back to a career , a city , a city , a partner and two or three or three or three children in a lot of time . 
so many lot of these things are more and like , like , are just the and everything all the time in the . 
the <unk> does n't mean to buy a red . 
it means that you can make the career you want to do , do n't . 
to remember that you ca n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able or ca n't ca n't be able . 
too many people in the 30s and look at themselves and myself and say , their say , " what did i have done ? what did i just thought ? " 
i want to change what people do in the do . 
this is a story that shows how it can . 
it 's the story of . 
it was my in my office when she was 25 , because she her it had a the . 
she said she 'd like to work in the art , or in the , but she had n't decided , she would have been in the last few years . 
because the was , she lived with her friend , who had more his than his . 
and even though their were , their were much worse . 
they often in the , but then she turned up and she said , " your family ca n't you , your friends . " 
and one day , there were very early and almost all the entire hour . 
she had bought a bought , and she spent the morning her deal , but then you look at the blank , which came to the words : " in the emergency , please . " 
she was almost the when she looked at me and said , " who 's going to be for me if i have a car accident ? 
who 's going to be me when i have cancer ? " 
at the moment , i did n't have to say to say , " i " 
but there 's no music , which really care about . 
it took a better life , and i knew , this was her opportunity . 
i 've had a lot of my first time to see how the <unk> in the . 
and in the next weeks and months , i 've been three pounds of anyone who anyone everybody , anyone , whether or man or woman . 
first of all , i told her , she did n't have any , they would be a of a . 
and that 's what i 'm going to tell you something that would join you . 
it 's something that to give you for investment , invest in something to be next . 
i knew n't know about the <unk> and no one knows how the future of work , but i do n't know , the <unk> . 
so now , the time for this international job , this the , this the , which you 're trying to try . 
now , i do n't have the <unk> of the , but the ones that do n't count , even though they do n't have any . 
this is the . 
i said to say , the , but , but . 
second , i said , the urban is . 
good friends are willing to get to the airport , but , the people with people who are like to think about borders , what they find what they think what they 're talking about and where they 're working . 
this new thing , this new person comes to the outside the outside of the own . 
new things are made from " the , " friends . 
it 's true : the half of the is not the or not at all . 
but the other half it 's not , and do n't have it up there . 
half of jobs never have . so if you 're your boss to your neighbors , you ca n't have a job . 
it 's not a . spread that information . 
the final advice : what believed you could n't choose the family , but the friends . 
this was for her when she was , but as soon as soon as soon as soon as she wanted to hold your own family , if you get a partner and a family . 
i told her time , a new family , would be now . 
you might think that it 's better than 20 than 20 or 25 or 25 , and i agree with you . 
but the person you want to live or in your life , if anyone on facebook is not an progress . 
the best time to get your marriage before , before you have a , and that means that the in the in love in love in your love . 
your family , means , consciously on the and the what you do , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you 're just right . 
so what happened to do ? 
we went through her , and she found the brilliant of a the who was in a different state in a museum . 
this weak band did to get her work to get a work . 
and that gave you the reason to her friend who she her with her . 
now , five years later , it 's the for museums . 
she has a guy who she chose . 
she loves her new career and her new family , and she taught me a card , and she said , " this is the line : " in the , you 're not going enough . " 
<unk> sounds like sounds like it 's all easy , but that 's what i love in love . 
it 's so easy to help them . 
birds is like the planes , who just left the left and to somewhere to west . 
and right after the weather can make a little difference make the difference whether you 're in or in . 
this is equally true for the , the , or the , a good conversation , a beautiful , a beautiful a can be a tremendous impact for years and even over generations . 
this is an idea that all should be the that knows her . 
it 's just as easy to know what i said to . 
i 've got privilege this day as a every day : the are not the new power , so you 're on , you know , a , you use your own your own family . your family . 
do n't tell you what you do n't know , or not . 
your right now your life . 
thank you very much . 
in the entire industry , it was always our goal to connect the between and information , the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can our imagination . 
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter , which is a of a the , and computers are for every . 
but i wondered what it would be if there was no limit at all . 
i looked at what would look like . 
first , i 've developed this tool , which is into the digital world , so if you focus on the screen , it to the physical character . 
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d surgeons and surgeons can be at the at the bottom of the screen . 
so with that tool , the limit was so the . 
but our hands still remain the outside of the . 
how can we connect with the digital information with the digital information and the of our hands of our hands ? 
at microsoft , i 've worked with my mentor , the <unk> , the computer and a little room on the keyboard in a digital the . 
so that means that a computer screen and screen to make the of fingers and face , you can now put his hands on the keyboard , the , and with their hands . 
and windows and put a position in the room , you can you so easily as you can a book from a shelf . 
and then you can get through this book and it and , and all this on the of the . 
architects can their hands both their hands . 
so in these two examples , we can go into the digital world . 
but how if we do it all the time and the digital information instead of us ? 
i mean , many of you have already made this to articles online and later . 
but now you do n't have to worry about that anymore . 
here i have a " the . " 
so this view is going to get you through a head on your head , or the , or when your system is the geometry the geometry of our body . 
this idea , i began to think about this , which is n't just in the space in the room , but they make it up , so that we can make them and them . 
how would it look like a future ? 
so with mit media lab , i with my the <unk> and my collaborators the , i 've created a the . 
now , in this case , this is just like a tiny - in our world , and that means that computers , as humans are able to move this object everywhere -- at least in that little bit of . 
effectively , we have gravity and control motion by creating magnetic , and combine these . 
by doing this the digital program , we 're using it from the constraints through space and time , and we can move human movements now , and permanent in the real world . 
so example , as can be taught , or , and , and , and again in the real world . 
students can use this in order to learn complex concepts of physics and physics and , and unlike , or the , or this is a and experience that can touch and , and it 's very powerful . 
and even more , than just what we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the code of the world is actually transform our daily activity . 
as you can , digital information will not only us to show us to interact with interact with us as part of our physical environment , without ourselves of our physical world . 
today , we started starting by talking about borders , but if we remove the limit , it 's the only frontier in our imagination . 
thank you very much . 
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s . 
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get the government to a school for school , all paid . 
but my mother said , " no . " . " 
my parents wanted me to engineer it . 
after they the , they believed that the only way to happiness is a safer and good job . 
it 's not important if i do n't have the job or not . 
but my dream was to become a chinese the . 
that 's me i on my . 
it has a very to start with the start , so i tried to try to go to the . 
i actually wrote the on the , and on the side of a the . 
but the adult does n't give my idea . 
the adults did n't believe it was seriously with me . 
only my friends had me , but they were also children , just as i am myself . 
and with 15 years , i knew that i was too old to with the training . 
so my dream would never be true . 
i was afraid that i could only take the rest of my life just a perfect second . 
but that 's so much . 
so i had to look at my head , to find a different . 
no one for me to teach me ? well , too well . 
so i started to . 
i the my hunger to the <unk> with my book on a book and the , and i was an extraordinary in an extraordinary woman , as the <unk> tradition , " by this book , " in " in the " 
[ " the <unk> " ] [ " ] " history " from the <unk> in 1995 , i came into the united states , and what books did i first read ? " 
of course , books that are banned in china . 
" the good earth " from the life of chinese . 
it 's simply not just as propaganda . i understood . 
the bible is interesting , but odd . 
but that 's a subject for another time . 
but the fifth commandment taught me taught me a way : " you need your father and your mother . " 
" honor , " i thought , " this is so different and much better than this . " 
that was my kind of way to try to get off the <unk> and the relationship to my parents . 
through with a new culture , i started reading the <unk> . 
this whole dynamic . 
for example , for example , i did n't really have this very first , because chinese students in this with this . 
it never occurred to me that china does n't have to be in the center of the world . 
so a map tells something about the personal perspective . 
the <unk> is read is nothing new . 
in the academic world , it 's a the . 
there 's even the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> . 
comparison and give a understanding of a . 
so i thought , if , if you read reading in the research , why does n't live in everyday daily ? 
so i began to read two books at the same time . 
you can act of people -- [ " franklin " by the , " john " by david , who was the same event , or with friends with shared with their experiences . 
[ " we " . " -- " life is like a the " from the , -- and stories in various cultures , like joseph the <unk> book . " the " ] and for example , had to . 
in , in the , the were the , the political events and political nature . 
in the , they were all in nature : , social and social -- interesting . 
if you make a language , it 's also fun to read the <unk> in two languages . 
[ " the " for " the for " thomas " the waste of the water -- the <unk> of the " the " rather than me in the translation , i figured out how much i can win . 
by translation , for example , i realized that " happiness " happiness " joy " means . " 
" in the chinese means " new mother . " the . " 
books for me , like an magical , you , i 've got one connection to the people and the present . 
i know that i 'm never touched , or i feel . 
a dream is not really compared to comparison which has many other . 
i came to the belief that it 's not the only purpose to be true . 
his purpose is to bring us to in the , where dreams , where our passion and our happiness . 
even a dream can dream this purpose . 
because of books , i 'm here today , happy , happy with a purpose in life , with a lot of time . 
like books always be with you . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
when i was eight years old , there was a new girl in the class , and she was so curious to be as girls . 
she had the hair and a little the <unk> , was in and . 
in the , i decided , until i got a the plan . 
so i stayed one day in a school , much longer , and i was hidden in the <unk> . 
when the air was , i came down , i went into the classroom , and i took the <unk> of the <unk> . 
and then i did it . 
i the notes of my the , just some few . 
all the . 
when i wanted to make this book , i noticed to me that some of my other had to be pretty good grades . 
so , i the in the every room , all of the . 
i gave all of the , and i myself , because i because i was also all the time . 
i 'm still even more about my behavior . 
i do n't understand where the thought came . 
i do n't understand why i was so good at this . 
i felt fine . 
i do n't even know why i never been used for it . 
it was so obvious . 
i was never caught . 
but most of me , me , why did it feel so that this little girl was so good ? 
i 'm not happy . 
it 's so weird , so profound . 
we know that babies are under suffering . 
similarly as primates . the are inherently from nature . 
we know that the of is among in the united states . 
but i never study a study that told me their or their or their the . 
so to do that , we need to look at the literature , because the novel is the laboratory that the in all the possible forms . 
is it an alternative to say that if we did n't have to have no literature ? 
so they do n't have a the , " no " . " 
no the king , not " out of the night . " 
no shakespeare . 
that 's where the <unk> of the , because we lose , " and , " the great " the , " the " the <unk> . " 
no way , no the , no the . i know it 's in to say that the has the answer to everything , but in the , he really got it . 
this year , we celebrate this 200 . the <unk> on the search for looking at the time , " and his analysis of the creation and the , and the thing that we have hope . hope . 
think about think , think of feelings , right ? 
we think about the little boy that 's trying to sleep . 
we think thinking about a piece of cake , in the <unk> . 
we forget how the his vision was . 
we forget how the it is . 
this kind of books are designed for the <unk> like the . 
i do n't know how the is , but let 's say , he 's . 
let 's look at the why the novel and the that are the and so well . 
is it so obvious that can drive on -- there 's such an alternative basis for a story ? 
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard at the <unk> , because think what happens when we 're . 
when we go to , we tell ourselves a story . 
tell us stories about the lives of the other people , and they make it bad , because they 're so that it 's us bad . 
as a , of the history , and the audience , we know how much detail it has to be able to get the knife into the . right ? 
there 's no way to make all of us , and , and . 
in the first band , " in the world , the , one of the great , thinks about his care , and , in the course of sentences , they 're as long as they get him , " wait ! " wait ! i would love
everything you give me and give me joy , maybe someone else might be happy joy , maybe even in this moment . " 
this is the story that he 's talking about , and from there about the <unk> that the , every new , he discovered in his discovered , his the in his private the . 
we 've got to admit that the and the are the . 
<unk> friends would have to leave the country if they want to with him with him . 
but you do n't need to go back to realize that it 's hard work . right ? 
there 's a . 
it 's a the feeling that needs to be . 
what does the ? 
it 's like information . 
it 's like details . 
in fact , the <unk> brown hair and little the . 
i want like photos . 
that 's why we have so successful . 
basically , the language of science and science . 
when the <unk> this , suddenly out of the door , and he the of his the , he this behavior . 
he says , " you might think that the 's is , but it 's not something else , a text a text , or a . " 
he says , " there 's scientific worth of value . " 
and what it 's trying to show us is that the is and makes us look , but in her core , it 's a search for knowledge , the truth and the truth , : the <unk> , the better , the better . 
in , that 's for the way to wisdom . 
he says , " a woman that we need that makes us suffering us , the us a greater and more complex more feelings than the genius of a man who 's interested . " 
does he tell us about us that we are looking for women ? 
no . i think he 's going to tell us that he tells us to tell us about ourselves . 
is there a different sense that makes us in this particular way ? 
how do we feel our hidden and the ? 
how do we feel different with different kinds of sound ? 
freud was going to write about that . later . 
one day , was a by a very young man who was by the thought he was his wife . 
and freud says , this man is kind of odd , because he does n't even know what his wife does . 
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that . 
the poor creature is lower under the . 
instead , he looking for things that his , without it , so the behavior . 
she too or she to with a man ? 
[ freud ] says that the man is to the of his wife . 
the novel is very good at this point . 
the novel describes very well as much of us , but not exactly the . 
because the more we are , the more dangerous to us . 
so i do n't think that 's not going to do things or illegal things . 
we tend to become very . 
and i think about myself about eight years ago , but i also think about the story that i heard in the news . 
a woman from michigan , because she was designed by himself by a self - year the , the news for himself . 
for a whole year . 
they tried trying to get the new friend of their shoes into the shoes , and i admit , when i heard this , i was with . 
because ... let 's let 's be honest . 
what does it mean , creativity , creativity , right ? 
this is something a little novel . 
this is something from a novel of the <unk> . 
<unk> is one of my favorite . 
she 's the most the and the woman in the american literature . 
you know , " two the in the train , and " the mr. the , " it books to how to give you the spirit of our mind , and we 're in the realm of the rich that are in the in between the
take tom the , your character . 
first of all , they want to be tom , and they 've got , and he 's got them , and what they had once , and they 're like by the , and he responds on their name , he name their jewelry , he 's her
this is a method . 
but what do we do ? we ca n't make it as like tom . 
i ca n't give the world anywhere , even though i 'd like it to some days . 
it 's a shame , because we live in a long - time . 
we live in an era - time . time . 
we are all good social citizens of social media that are currency in the , right ? 
do we tell us novel ? i 'm not sure . 
let 's do what characters do if you 're not sure if you 're in a . 
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the <unk> . 
people think about the , think about his professor as a professor , this great . 
but i liked to the <unk> , the boss of the <unk> with the face of a rat , the <unk> needs , the <unk> genius , the <unk> genius . 
that 's me so familiar . 
so , needs his help , the him and , and the stories of stories . 
but when you start to start starting to start with something , and eventually in " the six " as a the , and all of his solution , is the to the and says , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we are proud of them . " 
and he says that there would be no the at the <unk> , the would not n't want to shake the shake . 
that 's one of the few times that we can see back into the stories , and , and i find this little very smart , but also is , right ? 
it seems like it 's not an emotional , but it 's a problem . 
it 's a moment on a moment on a different . 
and in the next moment , they 're on an wavelength . 
suddenly , it to this thing that he has to him before . 
is it really that easy ? 
what if a really a problem ? if it only about how we deal with the other relationship ? " 
maybe we would n't be the on the . 
we could make ourselves . 
but i like the . 
while we 're waiting for , we still have the literature as a . 
literature alone the . 
literature alone , she can the them . 
and who 's all the : the good news , the tom , the crazy the , the <unk> , the <unk> . 
we 're in society . 
thank you very much . 
i was about 10 years old , and on a the age with my father in my father , a the in the northern part of the new york . 
it was a great day . 
the forest . 
the sun would look at the rock like glass , and if there was no path , you would have almost that we were going to be the first people that go through this forest . 
we came to our the . 
i saw the little hut on a cliff and looked across a the , beautiful , as something called horrible . 
behind the roof , there was a bunch , maybe four square , with the , the <unk> and a old the . 
i was amazed , i was angry and confused . 
the were too lazy to the what they had -- who they thought , would they were going to run ? 
the question was asked me , and i asked them to ask them : 
who are we looking for us ? 
how do it also or where it might be us who are behind us behind us in istanbul ? 
who are the behind us in rio ? or in paris or london ? 
this is in new york the , the <unk> of every day of every day tons of 2000 and 2000 tons . 
i wanted to them -- as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who make the job . 
how is it to wear a uniform and wearing that wear ? 
so i started a with them . 
i went to the , the and , and went to and in the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still a . 
i have to go deeper . 
so i took a job as a the . 
i did not just with the truck . i was the . 
and i ate the mechanical the and the snow . 
it was a wonderful privilege and an exciting experience . 
everybody asks to the . 
he 's there , but not as the as you think about , and days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty quickly . 
in the weight , you can just hard . 
i know people who had this number of years , and their body were still holding to weight her body , from tons . 
and then there 's the danger . 
after the statistics of the , industry is the job in the under the 10 countries in the country , and i learned why . 
you 're all the entire day in traffic , all over the . 
everybody wants to stop and often do n't do n't have enough . 
that 's really bad for the workers . 
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the <unk> and terrible . 
i also learned about the <unk> of . 
if you look away from the <unk> , and from the back of the city of a city , you can see that the is like a itself . 
he does n't listen to . 
it 's also like a kind of the or the . 
he has to be in movement . 
and then there 's the stigma . 
you put the uniform and occasionally , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- you get your traffic with your car , or you 're going to close to your apartment , or a coffee in your , and you come and you and say
i think this particular because i believe that the staff of the are the most important person on the streets of the city . that 's three reasons . 
they 're the rest of the public health . 
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient , and it would take out of the <unk> and the and the would give us on very much ways . 
so , diseases that we 've been achieved for decades and decades , they would spread and us . us . 
the economy takes it . 
if we do n't look at the old stuff , we do n't have a place for the new , and the motors of our economies is starting to start when the is consumption . 
i 'm not changing the capitalism , i 'm just looking at the . 
and then that 's what i call our , the . 
i mean , by just how fast we 've been used to movement today . 
we do n't care about ourselves , our , our or our , or the . 
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know that there 's people on the other side that are care about . 
and so what i want to do today is some ways of how we think about how to think about how to improve the and them into this , how you create a city that are sustainable and . 
your work , i think , is kind of the . 
you can see the streets every day . 
they wear in many cities . 
you know when you can expect it . 
and your work makes us do our . 
they 're like a the . 
the that they it , let us make us ourselves before our before our the , and , and we have to have to be able to raise any price . 
the days after 9/11 , after 2001 , i took the <unk> of a the on the street , and my little son , and ran the and , and there was a man who drove his the , he was doing it . 
and i tried to him for his work -- on this day all day days , but i started to cry . 
and he looked at me and just looked and said , " everything 's fine . " 
" everything is fine . " 
first of all later , i started my research and the and met the husband . 
his name is the , and we worked working together ; eventually we got good friends . 
i wanted to believe that the was right . 
everything is fine . 
but in our efforts , change the way we on this planet as a planet , we have to look at all the cost , including the very cost of work . 
and we have to be informed to help the people who do this work , how we think about how to build systems about , which is a of the last 40 years , and the world , and to us to other species of garbage that can be
the challenge , we think when we talk about waste , three percent of the national . 
it 's a remarkable statistic . 
in your lifetime , in your lifetime of your life , if you look next to the next time , whose job is to get behind them , they take a moment time they 're . 
take a moment to get yourself . 
hello , hi , what goes ? 
that 's not enough . 
hello , hi , what goes ? 
my name is the <unk> , and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth . 
in fact , my mother six directions , and leave me poor little air . the air . 
that 's why i have the , which means that means that i 'm all the time . 
look at that . 
it 's a . i 'm a lot of the , the and . 
it 's not genetically . 
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it . 
nobody has the of my mother , and i did n't get it because parents my parents are what they are . 
you just get them through accidents , like the one of my birth was born . 
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me with me because you all have seen in a point in your life . 
let 's just go to . 
it 's just a christmas in christmas . you see the beautiful circles of looking at a and what you see ? 
<unk> . 
and you think , " why ca n't i be a little bit ? " 
i 've got to say you : i 'm 99 problems , and it 's only one of them . 
if there was a species of arguments , i have a . 
i 'm the , and i live in new jersey . 
now , if you do n't feel better , then i do n't know . 
<unk> park in new jersey is my hometown . 
i love the fact that my the and my have the same . 
and also , i love the fact that i could go home from my house to new york city if i wanted to . 
a lot of people with people do n't do , but my parents ca n't not ca n't do a " . " 
the mantra of my father was , " yes , you can do it ! " can . " 
so if my three older sisters the , i with . 
if my three older sisters down to a public school , my parents to , so i could go , and if we were not all the , all of the <unk> my mother 's mother . 
my father brought me to me when i was five , by using his feet on his feet . 
another one of his was to put a camera in front of my nose , so i 'm going to take her . 
my inner was very strong , and as -- yeah . so , on the first day in kindergarten , i was walking like a the who had a to a . 
and then , there was only six in my city in my city , and all were my family . 
today , we have 20 countries in the city , and they 're still all my family . 
i think no one has ever noticed that we do n't have a . 
it was before , and before it took it for the , " i hate to use " as a " . " 
the people i grew up with did n't have with my faith . 
but they were very worried that i could possibly to maybe . 
and i explained to tell you that i spent away from my entire three entire life , so , the from the to the to a the . 
i have at the mit . 
yes , on . it 's crazy . 
my parents could n't afford to afford , so they sent me to me . 
i learned how to the on the , so i can walk on walk . 
and i 'm from the , where it 's really important to be the , so if my friends , my , i also . 
and if my friends my friends on the coast of the , i do n't . 
i spent my summer in a summer , because my parents were afraid that if we were not going to die every single summer , one day . 
the <unk> often out that my dad wanted to me , so i used the milk of the , the into the dead sea , and i know how the water in the eyes , and i thought , " it worked ! it worked ! "
but we found a we found : . 
i have to say , it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a left , who ca n't even be . 
now i can stand on the head . 
my parents always me that i would be able to make sure that not was not impossible , and my dream was it was at the general . " 
because of , i , i had a great scholarship at the university , the university state university , because i have every minority of . 
i was kind of the <unk> of the <unk> . 
everybody loved me . 
i do n't like all kinds of homework , not so much , got to get all of my classes , getting in all of these . 
every time i saw a scene from " the <unk> , my teacher my teachers . 
but i never got a role . 
so in my office , the <unk> , a piece of the " dance , " dance . 
a piece of a over a girl . 
i was a girl with girls . 
so i said , everywhere , " finally , i get a role ! 
i have a ! 
finally ! 
thank god , thank you , i 'm free ! " 
i did n't have the role . 
<unk> brown had got the role . 
i went to the state of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked her why she told me she was n't going to mention the . 
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't do the character . " 
i was born for this role , and she gave them a without a . 
college the life . 
hollywood is known to physically healthy actors . 
after i went back home . my first role was as a the in a the . 
my dream was true . 
and i knew that soon from the " . " 
but instead , i stayed a the system that was just the to the , but i realized that there was no the , . 
they only perfect people . 
but , you know , the are the rule . 
i grew up with the <unk> , the <unk> and the and , and all of these women had common : they were the . 
so i became the . 
my first job was it was famous to new york city new york city to new jersey , and i 'm never going to the face of the first time i ever stopped , forget him in the streets to new jersey with a the with a
i was in the united states in the united states , i 've also done in the middle east in arabic , the and the . 
some people say , i 'm the first the in the arab world . 
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you 've never heard of the bad little bit that women are not , and they find us . 
in 2003 , my brother from a mother and father , dean the , and i with the new yorker new american the , that 's already going to be right now . 
and our goal was to be able to take the negative image of americans from in to change the media and at the point that , and , and not . 
the of the was much easier than the challenge against the stigma of disability . 
my big breakthrough was 2010 . 
i was been when i was an activist in the <unk> " the " the . " 
i 'd like to go to the <unk> river , and she was me into a studio , and i sat down to a chair . 
so i looked at the <unk> looked at and said , " sorry , can i get a different chair ? " 
and she looked at me , and she said , " five , four , three , two ... " 
and we were live ! live ! 
so i had to go on the table of the , so i did n't fall out of the screen of the screen , and when the interview was finished , i was me . 
there was my opportunity , and i had it , and i knew that i had never me back again . 
but mr. the did not me , but he made me a , and my chair my chair . 
at the work with keith , i 've learned something learned : all the people in the internet are internet . 
people say , kids are cruel , but as a child or a child or adults never been me on me . 
in the world wide web , i am talking with my disability of the . 
so when i look at online , i look like , " the , why ? 
" the , is the <unk> ? " 
and my favorite : " the <unk> . 
did it work ? 
we should be for them . " 
in fact , even my disability into the <unk> record : the , the , the . 
a disability is such as . 
if a ca n't play , ca n't play . 
the are the biggest -- yes . that 's a score value . 
people with disabilities are the largest minority in the world , and we are the <unk> in the <unk> . 
the doctors said , " i never walk , but i 'm sitting here . 
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here . 
i hope that we can make a picture of disability in the media and create . 
maybe there would be fewer hatred in the internet when there were more positive . 
or maybe not . 
maybe it 's still a village to raise a child . 
my journey has led me to a very few places . 
i put on the red next to the <unk> and the <unk> . 
i 've been working in a film with adam the , and with my work , which is amazing . 
i 'm as a the with the with the <unk> , " to the around the world . 
i was the <unk> of the great new jersey in the national center . 
i said , " the , a , who 's trying to give someone to the chance of a chance of my parents . my parents . 
but one of the moment that most -- before this -- the moment that , when i was before the first man , the like a and like a bee , the , and the way as the as i do . 
this was the only time that my father ever seen one of mine , and i was going to talk to this presentation . 
now , god your soul , your dad , dad . my name is the <unk> , " if i can , can you can . " 
there was a time where we 're big problems . 
at the 21 , july , the <unk> from the apollo and , and he got back to the ocean of the . 
armstrong and the were alone , but their presence on the left was the peak of a the , the . 
the <unk> was the largest in the history of the united states of america . 
to go to the moon , it 's about to billion dollars billion dollars worth of worth , or four percent of the <unk> . 
apollo the created for 400,000 people and created the collaboration of companies , universities and universities . 
people died , except the of the . 
but until the end of the end , 24 people to the moon . 
from the 12 that are its surface , after death of the last year , now the oldest . 
but why did they go ? 
they did n't go back to go back to the old and , and something that all 24 later -- a new sense that our home is small and small . 
why did they go ? the , they , because president wanted to show the to that his had the better . 
but most words on words on the university of giving a better . 
for all , it was n't just a victory of the across the east during the cold war . 
at the time , this was a feeling about the <unk> of technology . 
it was in the moon , because it was something great . 
the <unk> happened in front of a ago a long series of technological . 
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the airplane , penicillin and a vaccine against tuberculosis . 
and in the middle of the century and polio smallpox eradicated . 
technology seemed to have something about what 's called the <unk> a " the <unk> . " 
for most of the human history of human history , we could n't even faster than a horse or a boat with a , but in the year , the apollo was 10 to 10 kilometers per hour per hour per hour . 
since 1970 had no human beings on the moon . 
no one has ever faster than the presence of the apollo , and the <unk> optimism is about the power of technology , but to the technology that we 've had to use clean to clean energy cancer , or the world from the hunger , seem
i remember , as a the , . 
the of the apollo 17 saw me , and my mother was me , not too much in the <unk> of the <unk> . 
i had a idea that was going to be the last , but i was sure that there was going to be in my life in mars . 
the <unk> " something happened with our ability to deal with big problems with technology , has become a . 
you hear it everywhere . 
we 've it here in the last two days at ted . 
it comes in front of us , if we looked at ourselves and ourselves themselves with , and with things like things like and social media and social media , or algorithms , the <unk> . 
it 's nothing wrong with most of these things . 
they have our lives and . 
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity . 
what happened ? 
there 's a the explanation from silicon , where you 've noticed that in have been done less than chinese companies than in years , intel , microsoft , apple and apple . 
in silicon valley you used to be markets , in particular , the <unk> , which are the company . 
in silicon valley , it turns out that each of have gone to lead to ideas , and instead of problems . 
but this explanation is not very good enough . 
it explains mostly what silicon does n't happen . 
even their its times small feet , tiny 10 years ago , a 10 years within 10 years . 
investors had always been able to invest energy technologies in technologies like energy , which is a carbon and , and its development , and never have never been able to change the development problems without the problems . 
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a big problem , more complicated and the . 
sometimes we 're not going to embrace the big problems . 
we could fly to mars if we want . 
nasa has even a plan . 
but for mars , would be a political decision of public , and so it 's never going to happen to happen . 
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks that there are be done in the earth that are done to be done . 
another time we ca n't solve the big problems because our political systems are fail . 
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth , the sources , solar wind , wind and wind , less than two percent , and the reason for is very small . 
coal and gas are cheaper as solar wind and wind and efficient is cheaper than the . 
we all want to alternative to keep the <unk> , but it does n't exist . 
now it 's so , and , and all of all of the same opinion of what national and international development would be : mainly a lot of economic development in development and development and development and a price of carbon .
but in the current political climate system , there is no hope that the u.s. of the united states or the international the , and international the . 
sometimes are more complex problems that affect the sounds , but not like that . 
it 's been believed that it was happening on the . 
but 30 years of research have taught us that political policy , the impact . 
technologies can things like - like systems like systems and systems , and , but it 's going to be famine , and there are no governments . 
eventually , large problems are sometimes the solutions , because we ca n't understand that problem . 
president , the was told the war , but you were discovered that there were many kinds of cancer that most of have been against therapy , and only for the last 10 years , seem to be effective . 
difficult problems are hard . 
it 's not true that we ca n't solve big problems with technology . 
we can , but we have to be able to have these four elements that are politicians and the public must be interested to solve a problem , institutions have to solve the solution ; it needs to be an issue problem , and we have to understand
the <unk> that led to a metaphor for the ability to be able to solve big problems , get these criteria . 
but this is a model which ca n't happen in the future . 
it 's not the year . 
there 's no the struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john kennedy , who makes everything and to an power , and do n't have a sense of the like the exploration of the solar system . 
but in the way , it was to end up to the moon . 
he was only three days . 
and it 's the that whether it really has a serious problem . 
we 're ourselves and the solutions are going to be the future . 
god , it does n't change any challenges . 
thank you very much . 
i want to invite you your eyes . 
imagine what you 're going on your . 
look at the door , their color and the material is made out of it . 
now , you get a group of the <unk> on your friends . 
it 's a the - the , and you just look at your and your . 
you 've got to introduce that . 
they 're the up , and up and down directly . 
and then they would directly your . 
bicycles , wheels , wheels , all the cross and the . the <unk> in the . 
now , you know about the threshold of your in your , your , or what 's on the side of your brain , and , in the room in the room . 
the light seems on to the . 
it does n't get you from a from a the . 
one is a horse . 
you can almost feel like his blue gets off your nose . 
you the <unk> , that it turned into the mouth . 
go over to him , out in your living . 
here , you want you to your . 
their clothes would just the , they , " they had a little of the , " while she 's on your the . 
now , me to your kitchen . 
the soil was replaced by a yellow the , and it came out to your the , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of " from the " , " in your hand , hand . 
okay . now let 's see the eyes . 
i want to tell you about a very competition about every year in new york in new york city . 
it 's called " the <unk> . " 
a couple of years ago , i wanted to think of this the as a the , and expected , the <unk> of the <unk> . 
it was a bunch , and a few a few of , very different and . 
they 're looking at hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of numbers . 
in fact , the names of and the of the of the . 
and it whole thing in just a few minutes . 
it 's about giving who up the of a of a the <unk> . 
that 's crazy . 
these people have to have skills . 
i began to talk with some of them . 
this is ed , a guy who came out of england , and there 's one of the <unk> . 
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice that you have this particular theory ? " 
and ed said , " i 'm not a the . 
i just have an average memory . 
everyone who 's going to tell you that he or she just has a . 
we 've all together , open - , techniques , to help these incredible the techniques , the techniques that invented the two billion years ago , and the techniques that used to learn how to talk to his , and using the to of books to
and i thought , " wow , how is that i 've never heard of it ? " 
we stood outside out of the <unk> , and ed , and wonderful , brilliant , and some funny english guy says me to me , " josh , you are an american journalist . 
talk to you ? " 
i said , " what ? indian ? why ? " 
" i 'd like to talk to the <unk> how to the order of a the - the . 
it would be the world prove that everybody here . " 
i told him , " i 'm not the , but , but you would teach me teach me . 
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ? " 
and that was the beginning of a very exciting journey for me . 
i 've spent a lot of the next year , i not just spent my memory , but it 's also to understand it and understand how it works , why it does n't work and what could be potential . 
i have a lot of interesting people . 
this is , for example , for example , . 
he 's suffering under the , and probably the worst memory of the world . 
his memory is so bad that he does n't look at his the , which is amazing . 
although though it was so tragic , he figured it in how much our memory our us who we are . 
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned from the spectrum . 
<unk> . 
he was the film for the <unk> character in the movie . " 
we spent a afternoon in the public in lake city . 
and i came back to make a whole pile of across the memory , the two years ago and more in the in the and later in the . 
and i 've got a whole bunch of interesting things . 
particularly struck me that there was a time to the to the memory , not nearly as much as today . 
there was a time to people in their memory , and it out of the . 
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the , to the <unk> , the , the computer , the smartphone -- the it -- it makes us easier to our , the human ability to
these technologies have changed our modern world , but at the same time . 
they changed us that we changed us , and i would argue that they would have changed us . 
without the , sometimes it seems like when we forget about how that goes . 
one of the last places of the earth , where you still find people who are still passionate about their memory , memory , and , is this unique the . 
in fact , he 's not so unique , there are the like this around the world . 
and that made me into the , i wanted to know how these guys do this . 
a few years ago , a university at university london group of brought into the lab . 
they wanted to know : is the structure or structure of their brains different than the rest of us ? 
the answer was : no . 
are you smarter than we ? 
she gave them a pile of the , and the answer was : actually did n't . 
however , there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain of a brain and a that was compared to it . 
if you put them together in a brain , and your brain , as you can imagine , faces and images pictures images of images , you can see that in the regions of regions of the than the rest of us . 
it seems like you 're going to use the part of your device that used to use and use . 
why ? why can we learn from something ? 
and in order to improve the best memory of a kind of a , in every year , every year to go with a new technology to the more of more and the rest of the rest . 
this is my friend named the <unk> , the <unk> . 
on the table in front of him , 36 the , he himself within a an hour with a technology that he invented and as a . 
he used to show a similar technology at the rate of the in order to get the <unk> in a half an hour . 
yeah . 
and even though there 's a kind of techniques to put a bunch of things in these the <unk> , but they all created the techniques on the concept , the psychologists called the <unk> . " 
it 's so much about the concept of this concept . it 's like following : if i look at two people to look at the same word , and you say , " tell you that there 's a person called the . " 
that 's his name . 
and you say , " the , there 's a person who 's a . " 
now , when i go back to a moment now you 'll come back and say , " you know the word that i 've you in some time ago ? 
do you know what word was it ? " 
the person who person the person called the , remembers , remembers with the probability of the word that the person who person the person with the person . 
same word , the <unk> ; it 's weird . 
what 's going on here ? 
well yeah , the name is means nothing . 
he 's absolutely all of all the <unk> that in your head . 
but the profession of the , we know . 
so wear carry white the . 
so people have a on their hands . 
so smell , when they come home from home . 
maybe we might even know a . 
and when we hear the word first , let 's use this with the word , and it later . 
and the secret of what 's going on , and the secret , to be able to look better out of a way to put the names of the into the state -- one information that has no connected to meaning in meaning in a sense way and meaning
one of the techniques can make two 500 years back to the <unk> . 
she was known as the <unk> . 
the story of his story is like : there was a poet called the who a the . 
he was interested in the conversation , because at the time , if you wanted to make a really big party , you would not have a the , but a poet . 
he carries his poem in the front and front of the room , and the right now , exactly the moment came up with me and all the . 
not 's not only all the dead , their bodies are up to the <unk> . 
no one can tell anyone who was there , nobody knows where who has . 
the body can not be properly . 
it 's an tragedy after the other . 
<unk> stands , outside , the only actor of this disaster -- he 's his eyes , and he 's got to see him in front of his eye , where . 
and so he takes the <unk> of the hand , and it leads to the . 
in this moment , something that we all know all know that we do n't matter how much we have , or the , of our colleagues , we have a very good and memory . 
i would ask you to tell you the first 10 words of the story about the , such as hard to find it difficult to find it hard . 
but i bet if you ask you to remember who in this moment on a moment on a the horse in your stomach , you might have the . 
so the idea of the is to create a building of the eye , and it with the images of things -- the dark , the -- the , the , the , the , the picture of the as it . 
this is a advice that goes back on over 2,000 years old , about the memory . 
so how does it work ? 
now , you 're invited to talk to you about ted talk , and you hold it out of memory , just like the would have done , he would have taken over the years ago . 
you 'd like that way : you imagine your . 
imagine a secret - crazy and crazy story with the images , to remind you that you were first to talk about these crazy talks . 
and then you go into your house and you see the noise on the back of the . 
and that would remind you your friend ed . 
and if you look at the , you to a , you to tell you . 
you take into your kitchen , and the fourth thing talking to talk to you was that strange journey to you for a year , and you 've got friends to help you remember you . remember you . 
so it turns out to the out of their -- not a word , which is confused , topic . 
the english notion " the <unk> , " the theme of , comes from the greek word " the " . " 
these are some of those people when people talked about the and in terms . 
the phrase said " the first " it 's " first in your . " 
and i thought it was just fascinating , and i 'm still , and . 
it 's also some the . 
i wanted to write something about this the of the . 
but there was a problem . 
the problem is that the <unk> are . 
it 's like a group of people who are sitting there and write a test . 
it 's already exciting if you 've got the <unk> . 
i 'm journalist , i need something to do something about it . 
i know that the of things happen in the minds of these people , but i do n't have access to it . 
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to go back to her position . 
and so i began , every morning , 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , i was able to learn something . 
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem . 
the name from a old the that i bought on the <unk> . 
i had to realize that it was much fun . 
i could never imagine this . 
it 's fun because it 's not about the memory . 
you 're getting better , these crazy , and hopefully images to your face . 
i 'm at it . 
here i am with my the . 
a couple of the and a the , who raised up to two small year , because the enemy is the enemy . 
i went to the same conclusion that i used to be a year earlier . 
and in front of me , it 's just as an experiment . 
it could be a nice the for my . 
the problem was that the experiment did n't like the same . 
i won the <unk> , which was really not supposed to happen . 
it was nice to be able to , and , and , but that was not what i wanted to do . 
these are just tricks . 
tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas the of our . 
you do n't have to build - or - or - to - to - to - to - able to from the to the . 
we often talking about people with memory , as if it 's a special , but that 's not true . 
good the are the . 
we tell us things better when we look at . 
we remember when we 're getting . 
we remember , if we have the opportunity to figure out why information and experiences to us why they have meaning , and if we put them into something that we can make sense in our sense of our senses , and if we can call the "
the <unk> , these the , they 're all shortcuts . 
in fact , it 's not real . 
they work because they work us to work . 
they 're us to be compassionate , and in a way that we 're not usually . 
but there are no shortcuts . 
these things are things in memory in memory . 
one thing i want to give you one way to do something that i did n't think about the man who does n't look at his the , learned , our lives are our lives of our memories . 
how much are we willing to live from our lives , our or our iphone , instead of telling us , how much are we going to lose , because we are so lazy that we do n't have the and ? 
i learned that the memory , in any of us , tremendous incredible . 
if we want to live a live life , we have to be the person who do n't remember . 
thank you . 
at the age of 27 , i made a job in the <unk> for a the . 
public schools in new york , i started to the . 
as every teacher , i led to tests and . 
i was homework . 
so when the work works , i grades notes . 
in fact , there was n't the only difference between the best and worst weapons . 
the iq of some of my students were not the . 
some of my favorite kids do n't get very well . 
that 's me . 
what you do in 7 . in , it 's difficult to do : the numbers , the <unk> , the area of a the . 
but none of these concepts do n't have these concepts . i 've been able to believe that all of my students my students all the students to learn how they could do and hard and hard enough . 
after a couple of years in school , i came to conclusion that we were able to understand a much better understanding for students and learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective . 
what do we do in the best measure is the benefits . but what if , if , in school and life lives much more than the ability and easy and learn easy to learn ? 
so i left the classroom , and a to . 
i started to kids and adults in all kinds of different situation , and i wondered who is successful and why ? 
my , and i went to the west institute . 
we were trying to predict what the would be , and would n't . 
we went to national and , and the to the children would go . 
we studied the that worked in very tough business , and asked them to teachers the teachers to the end of the , and they were able to improve their students of their students . 
we were partnerships with , and scientists , who are their of the . 
and who would make the money . 
so in all these different social systems , an individual as an act of success . 
it was not social intelligence . 
it was n't good , physical , and it was n't iq . 
it was brilliant . 
the is passion and passion for very long term . 
blindness is the . 
great is , if you look at a the machine , not just for a week or a month , but for years , and really hard to do this plan . 
life is life like a marathon , not the . 
some time ago , i started working in public schools in chicago . 
i asked thousands of students at the bottom of the to the for the , and then wait to a year to see who was done . 
it turns out that kids with kids are even more difficult at the , even if i do all the kinds of things , things like the same results , results - tests , even as they did it in the school . 
so it does n't just work in the and , but also in school , especially for children . 
so the main issue about this topic is for me that we know so little that the science is so little about how to do it . 
every day , my parents ask me and teacher and said , " how do we study the children of children ? " 
how did i teach to see a ? 
how do i do it for ? " 
the answer : i do n't know . 
what i know is that you 're not going to be done . 
our data show us that a lot of our people are not going to remain . 
in fact , surprisingly is not necessarily not necessarily not , but it 's also talent with talent . 
so far as the best idea that i 've been about the of , is called the . 
this idea has been involved at stanford university of research and the belief that the ability to learn is not , but they can change their . 
dr. the has shown that kids when you read about the brain and learn how it answer to the challenges of challenges and , very much more likely , because they do n't believe that failure is a state condition . 
this the posture is a great idea for the original . 
but we need more . we need more . 
i 'd like to finish my favorite , because we are so far . 
that 's the work that lies us . 
we need to best our best ideas and narratives and . 
we have to do whether we have successful . we have to be willing to have to , to have able to learn lessons and learn from . 
in other words , we need to be able to get kids . 
thank you very much . 
in the center of my work is the connection of our lives and our part of the environment , architecture from the natural , local conditions , and traditions . 
today , i example , as an example of projects . 
both of projects are in emerging , one in ethiopia and one in tunisia . 
they also have common that the different from different perspectives are a different part of the brain . 
the first example started with an invitation , a the - in capital . 
this is the kind of building that we us , my team , and me , as an example of what we should be shown . 
first of all , i thought i wanted to . 
so after we 've seen a couple of these buildings -- there 's a lot of them in the city -- we realized that they 've found three . 
first of all , these buildings are very empty , because they 're very large , where people ca n't afford to buy things . 
second , they need a lot amount of energy because the surfaces are out of glass , which heat inside , and then you need lots of lots . 
in fact , in a city that should n't supposed to happen , because they have pretty weather that 's going to 25 to 20 to 25 . 
and thirdly , they have their with and ethiopia . 
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition . 
and also , in the first , i was really working with the old market with the old market with this the center , where thousands of people go and , every day in day . 
it 's also this idea of space that uses the uses to create activity . 
so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a mall . 
but the question was , how could we create a building , building with these principles . 
the next challenge came to when we were looking at this , because it 's in a proper town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there . 
it 's between two that have hundreds of hundreds of meters . 
first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the walls of the building . 
it turns out to be a in a the that creates a building in the building that creates itself through its own shape and its sun and rain . 
in order to get this the , we get the idea of a with a little that is moving in every , because of because of the shape of the change . 
i also think : how do we close the buildings ? 
i really wanted to find a solution in the local . 
i began to think about think about how a concrete out of concrete with the , which the air , and the light , but in the form . 
and then i called these beautiful buttons in the <unk> . 
they have the characteristics of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire . 
we 're building it with these little bits , the windows , the air and air light into the buildings into the buildings . 
and that 's being done by these little , little bits that leaves the light from the of the to building the building a building . 
it was n't just the to with these ideas , because they thought , " this is not a nuclear mall . we did n't have it . " 
but then we realized that this idea of the is much more than the idea of a , because they can actually sell more . 
so the concept of the was too much , much more much , it 's not just because of the material compared to glass , but also because we do n't have any conditioning . 
so we created some the techniques that we used to use this project . 
the first time was to think about how we could make the building , in a city in a city that almost nearly a daily day . 
we created a call that we by on the roof on the roof . 
and under these the , we this as a new public space with space and , and that this . 
these on the roof on the roof collect the water into the . 
hopefully at the beginning of the next year , because we 've got the down to 5 . 
the second example is an the example of 2000 in russia and institutions in the . 
so to make a big project , the biggest project i 've ever designed , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture . 
during this analysis , i 'm particularly specifically to the , which is the 1,000 - old - old structure that was a by a wall , through 12 , and through by the lines . 
when i went to the site , the first step to create the existing streets to create the first 12 blocks , with the size of the size and properties like the in cities and in other cities . 
in addition , we some points in the into the into the concept of the , and it with straight lines , and that changed the original pattern . 
the last step was to think about the cell , the little cell of the project , like the apartment , as a of part of the . 
what was the best in a the climate for a apartment ? 
this is the , because , because of the <unk> between the two the that are created and created a natural design . 
so we put a pattern about the that most of the apartments are in this direction . 
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european , and the arab city . 
there are the blocks with the and in the , there are these compounds for 
it also the local wall that produces the density into the upper and a density in the . 
it also the concept of the . 
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different layers , and it into very dense to light into the ground , there are three different institutions , like a the and a kindergarten and a near a series of activity that are bringing
the roof , my the project on this project , the community is almost the to the space of the building . 
there can all the neighbors and together , and make things like a the a on the morning , from a building to another building . 
these two examples have created a common approach . 
they 're in emerging where you can see the cities literally . 
in these cities changes the changes of architecture in the and future of people the local communities and just as buildings . 
from that reason , it 's important to architecture , architecture , but actual solutions that have the relationship between the community and the environment , and the it to nature and connecting . 
thank you very much . 
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to you about the opinions . 
they 're so ubiquitous that they used to become the . 
there is one of my view of three . 
first of all : trust is faith in the , many . 
then goal : we need to trust more confidence . 
and a task : we should be able to rebuild the confidence . 
i believe that the claim , the goal and the challenge is wrong on the wrong ideas . 
so i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a to make a much better approach on the . 
first of the claim : why do people say trust ? 
and when i really talk to my knowledge , i know , i do n't know the answer . 
maybe it has some in some common or institutions , or in some other . 
i did n't see me . 
but i course , i can look at the places that the are the source to believe that it 's a . 
if you look at a look at a period of a , it 's not a lot of . 
in fact , people the people who were 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , still the . 
and the people who was very familiar about 20 years ago , still very familiar : the , nurses , nurses . 
we 're different between the , and by the way , the average citizens is almost right in the middle . 
but is that a good proof ? 
<unk> -- clear -- opinions . 
what could you do ? 
so they 're looking at the general mindset of people when you 're going to be certain questions . 
trust politicians ? trust they trust ? 
now , if you ask somebody asked , do you trust ? 
do you trust ? 
do you trust ? 
and then would you would say , " well ? " 
and that would be a reasonable response . 
and if you understand the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm not some of you , but not . " 
absolutely rational . 
in short , we 're in our short lives , we 're trust in different ways . 
we do n't think of it that we have every heart or a in a or . 
so i could like to say that i was given a given , i , the first class , the first class , but i would n't want to drive the . 
maybe i know i know that it 's not going to be good car . 
and i realized that my friend had a conversation on running , but maybe not that they 're a secret . 
simple . 
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different things look like , but why do n't we know this knowledge when we think about trust ? 
the , there 's a very bad thing about the actual , because they ignore the sense of the you . 
second , we come to the goal . 
the goal is to trust more confidence . 
honestly , i think that 's the stupid . 
i would n't do that . 
i would try to trust the more confidence , but not wo n't . 
i do n't even actively to trust . 
and those , for example , your would go into the hands of a certain event , which is like the , " the , " and then , " i , " i think , too much . 
" trust " is no the goal in this life . 
trust and should be the goal . 
and then you say , yes , ok , what is the most important , is not trust , but . 
the people from humans . 
and to do that , we need to look at three things . 
are you ? are you honest ? are you ? 
when we talk a person in the topics , and , then we have a good reason to trust their confidence , it 's be . 
it 's not the person , but it 's probably not . 
some of my friends are friends and honest , i would n't give you a letter , because they are the . 
i have friends that are very different in their own , but that 's what they do . 
and i 'm very happy about that i did not have a lot of friends that are and , but the . 
if you know , i did n't have it . 
but after that , we look forward , then , trust . 
trust is the response . 
so we have to do that , of course , that 's hard . 
over the past decades , we 've been trying to tackle up with all sorts of problems and experts and experts and experts and make it easier to save us . 
many lot of these systems have the effect . 
they do n't work like . 
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the is no longer going to take the baby to the world . " 
everywhere in our public lives , in our institutions in our institutions , state of this problem , and this need to stop and , but to the opposite . 
it 's people like the people from their tasks , by taking them . 
now , anyone can any examples . 
so that 's the goal . 
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be , and want to communicate to other , and if we want to whether if people , or politicians , politicians . 
it 's not easy . you 've got to do it . simple reactions or does n't matter . 
and now to do task . 
this as an actor of the describe to describe the . 
because it suggests that they should and i trust . 
we can do that for ourselves for ourselves . 
we can win a little bit . 
so 's how two people can improve your confidence . 
but ultimately , it 's self - confidence that it 's being done by another . 
you ca n't do it again what else are going to do . 
you have to give them to give you a trust . 
so you have to be smart . 
and of course , of course , is that you do n't usually get people all at the nose at the nose . 
but they also have to get older that they 're trustworthy . 
how does this ? 
that 's happening every day , everywhere . normal people do doing , very effective . 
here 's a simple example . 
the store , where i bought my neck , she me up , and they ask no questions . 
they take them back and give me back to me , or a couple of the in the . 
that 's great . i 'll you , because you 've been shown to me . 
there is an important morality . 
if you look at the as vulnerable , it 's a very good sense that you 're feeling and you to your own words . 
so our goal is not very difficult to recognize . 
it 's relationships between people , and the <unk> , and when the other one is different . 
so the morality of history is so much more about trust , or about faith , trust , or by the , or the , and a lot more about , and how you people , useful and simple evidence of their own .
thank you . 
you know , the best thing on the most are for me the films i can see . 
i love my own my with my kids with my kids , and when my daughter was four years old , we 've together , " the full of . " 
the film has no longer left . 
her , of course , was the <unk> . 
so she had a good excuse to wear a the dress and wearing a the . 
but if you look at this film , often look at , you see how he 's . 
we live in the world today , and we 're our children in a kind of a . 
but " the was inspired by the . 
he did n't have this trend . 
it has 40 years to continue this trend , -- interestingly -- a different movie , which a guy made out of metal and a guy with a girl with a girl by taking the of the of the . 
you know what i 'm talking about , right ? 
right . 
well , there 's a big difference between these two films , even tens of differences between the of , and all the movies that we look like today . 
first of all , there are a " in the very violence . 
the monkeys are quite aggressive , as the <unk> . 
but i think if the had been inspired by the government today , who would have said , " the , " the , you 're the <unk> of that we 've been . 
use your own shoes to order to read by computers , the evil of evil of the west . " 
but it does n't happen . 
another point that i 'm on " from " , " which is very unique , is that the <unk> and are even characters . 
this is what i saw the first time when i saw my daughter star , " which was years later , and the situation was different . 
at that time , i had a son . 
he was at the time for three years old . 
he was n't invited this guy . he was still too young . 
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister . 
so he 's a , and he 's the film , which is a the his mother his mother , and i do n't think he 's got what he was going on , but he 's got it safe in the . 
and i wondered what he was doing . 
did he the it to courage and human ? 
did he the that he 's a army to get the government ? 
in fact , there 's only boys in the universe , and the , and of course , who 's really cool , but during the time , you can the heroes with a student and a the to him the of the universe ,
compare it to " the <unk> of " . " 
how does your the make your film to a good end ? 
by dealing with everybody and a . 
this is the kind of world where i my children my -- , right , right ? and not in the world in the world , to fight with what 's pretty much of our world today . 
why is there so much power -- big -- in the movies that are children for our children , and so few more the ? 
there is a lot of good literature about the impact on the boys of the boys , and they should read it . it 's very good . 
however , i did n't read so much about how guys with this . 
i know from my own experience that the could n't use the model that i could have been able to find through the through the world of adults , in girls and boys together . 
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect to see that the <unk> starts , because that ends a movie , right ? 
i have my mission , i the girl . 
why are you there ? 
i do n't know what to do . 
the movies are very to the and their heart disease , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and other travel . 
it does almost like if you 're as a young animal , and if you 're a girl , you better get better the . 
there are more exceptions , and i 'm going to share the front of each of you . 
but they give a message to the boys that the boys are not be the . 
they 're willing to teach the girls how they could afford to the , but they do n't show the boys for the way they 're against the . 
there 's no way for you . 
there are also a couple of women who are going to write new stories for our kids and so and wonderfully and also , are still the . 
and the most common of all of course is a classic after the other , and each one of them is one of a boy , or a man , or two of two men who are friends , and son of his son , or
until , as many of you might think -- to this year , when they finished the movie " the -- " the <unk> . " 
i recommend him you all it . he 's on the internet . 
do you remember what the critic said , " the " ? " 
" oh , " i ca n't believe that aid has made a box . " 
it 's very good . let 's not get that of that . 
but as well , none of these films has the <unk> . 
i do n't know if you 've heard of it . 
it does n't have to that right , and meaning , but maybe we 're going to start a movement today . 
<unk> is a the , and in the middle of the <unk> these entertainment that she came with a girlfriend about the films that had seen . 
it 's very simple . there 's only three questions that you need to ask : there 's more than a character in the film , which is , and something ? 
try to get that individual . 
and talk about women in the part of the time ? 
and it 's in your entertainment to something else , than the guy that they both like ? 
yeah ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women who exist and talk talking about anything . 
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it very rare in the movies that we know and love . 
in fact , i found this week in the beginning to see a very good movie , " the . " 
you remember ? a lot of the in the <unk> , great the , a general sense of what a good is good . 
it falls out with the <unk> through the <unk> . 
i do n't think it 's not a majority of the -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the ordinary in a message where men and women during the . 
there are some good scenes in men in this deep , of fear , conversations , and the great moment , one of the <unk> has gone through a door and say , " you go to bed ? " ? " 
it turns out to be some hollywood . 
so let 's take a look at the numbers . 
in 2011 , under 100 the , what do you think how many of these were actually the ? 
11 . that 's not a . 
it 's not as many number of as the number of women who we just in the congress , so it 's the good . 
but there 's a number that bigger than that , and that will be this space . 
last year , the new york times published the government has the government . 
she says that she says that . 
one of five women in the united states that they 've been sexually in their lives in their lives . 
i do n't think that 's the blame of general . 
i do n't think it 's going to have anything to do anything . 
i do n't even think that and directly to do with something , but something 's going on , and when i hear this statistics , one of the things i think is a lot of the . 
who are these guys ? what are they doing ? 
what do n't you learn to learn ? 
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , violence with violence , and then the reward , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ? 
so let 's take this story ? 
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , just like the same the same thing , we find this world and these statistics , and we want them to . 
we 've got tools like " the , " and we hope hoping that will help , but i 'm also going to ask whether it 's going , when we 're at , at the same time , active or , to our , the
the <unk> is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking to here to the . 
i think , we 've got to find our very simple idea of the picture . 
the definition of view is already changing . 
you 've read the new york of the roles of the and the . 
they 're going to mess . 
our sons are going to find a way to adapt up with a new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that is someone who is his sisters and on your side , and the really bad guys who are men
i think we should be able to find the movies to find the <unk> that if we find them , and look for the search that are find the real courage to bring people together and say , and say , " i 'm on side , "
when i met my daughter , who was their the in " star wars , " you know what they said there ? 
<unk> . 
<unk> and the and the . 
so what have these two common together ? 
maybe it 's not just the <unk> dress . 
i think these two figures are experts . 
these are the two characters in film that know more than others , and their knowledge to with other people to help them help their potential . 
furthermore , they are leaders . 
i like this kind of job for my daughter , and i like this kind of job for my son . 
i want to do more tasks like this . 
i want less tasks to say my son said , " will go and say , " and tasks to sit with a team , maybe a team that will get to a woman , to help people become better and better people , the
thank you very much . 
i want to talk to you about the story of a the . 
i do n't know his name , but , but his story . 
he lives in a small village in the south . 
his village is near the . 
the drought , the poverty of this village and the <unk> . 
and when there was nothing there was him there , he left his village , he walked into the city , in this case , the , the capital . 
when he 's there , there 's no opportunities , no jobs , no way . 
at the end , he comes in a outside of the . 
it may be a year , but nothing . 
one day , he will take him by a man who wants him to lunch , to dinner , dinner for dinner . 
he 's this dynamic group to young people , and they give him an opportunity . 
he gets a little money to get out of new clothes and buy money to home . 
this is him this young lady . 
eventually he . 
he starts a new life . 
his life has a sense . 
on a beautiful day in the , under the sky , a walk into the air . 
this the <unk> with the was the <unk> and , and this group of young people had been the to have a high - with . 
how could the story of a the that just trying to go out in the ? 
he had waited . 
he had a an opportunity to focus on the future , and it was the first opportunity to give him . 
it was the first thing to him from a state that we call " the . " 
and his story is again over again over the urban areas around the world . 
it 's the story of the , urban youth , who in and london and something different than something . " 
young people promise away from the city , from their the , jobs , work , wealth , but young people do n't have a lot of wealth of their cities . 
often , it 's the youth that are under the . 
in 2030 , there are three of five in five cities in the cities as 18 years . 
if we do n't young people in the growth of the cities , if we do n't give them opportunities , " the , the in terrorism , in violence and violence in cities . 
in my the , the , suffering , 70 percent of young people are under unemployment . 
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school . 
they do n't actually do anything . 
last month , i went back after the <unk> , and i went to the <unk> , the hospital , where i was born . 
i remember myself , in front of this the hospital , and asked me , what if i would never be here ? 
what if i had to the same condition of " forced ? 
would i have become ? 
i 'm not sure what i want to do . 
the reason for that reason for this month was in fact , the of a the for young leaders and entrepreneurs . 
i spent about 90 young leaders . 
we set up together and create a solutions for the largest challenges of their city . 
in the room , a young man , the . 
he visited the university in university , and his . 
there was no jobs and no options . 
and i remember how he told me that he had a the , and frustrated was the perfect goal , member , to be and other . 
they were people like him . 
but this story takes another different . 
in , are the biggest obstacles to come from to b , the streets . 
well , 23 years , the have completely destroyed , so that the best thing is best . 
<unk> did the opportunity and them . 
he 's called a the . 
he began to stop the on the <unk> that could n't afford otherwise . 
and with his family and friends , he bought to 10 , and he 'll be able to stay at the moment in the next three years . 
how do you tell this story from the other ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i think it 's his ability to recognize a new opportunity . 
it 's the <unk> , and i think that the can be the means to be " means . " 
it 's the young people in the to create the economic opportunity that they 're so desperately . 
you can teach young people to be entrepreneurs . 
i want to talk to you about a young man who was on one of my meetings , the <unk> , a the . 
he helped me to give the some of some young people at the summit , and to show them how to build innovative and complex . 
he 's actually the first the who has seen the <unk> since two years , until before was there , used to be artificial the that came from the ship from the abroad , if you wanted to the flowers on the wedding . 
when you ask someone , " when did you last the last time you 've seen the last time , " then the answer was many of the who during the <unk> : " never . " 
so saw an opportunity . 
he started with a the with . 
it took a outside , and started to the and the , which he could survive in the climate . 
he started , he started to with flowers , and private and , and business around the city , and he was working on the of the first public parks in the last century years . 
there 's no public parks in the . 
he wants to create a place where families and young people are come together , and as he says , he can teach the beautiful things about life . 
just like this , he does n't have a , because they 're too much water . 
so the first step is to young people to inspire , and in this room , the had a huge impact on the other people in the room . 
they had never really thought about that business . 
they thought to work for a work , or for government , but that story , its innovation , had a strong impact on them . 
he the them to look at their city as a place of view . 
he the them that they can be entrepreneurs that they could change the change . 
at the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the largest challenges of their city . 
they had the local solutions for local problems . 
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a really big , but the young people would need to their ideas . 
they need the and to develop her business and develop her business . 
they 're young people with the resources that they need , they give them the support that they need to be able to make ideas and they will going to create opportunities for growth . 
for me , for me , that 's more than just a of a . 
it 's about social effects . 
<unk> sell not just flowers . 
i think he sells hope . 
his design is called the , when he created the view of human beings to change their city . 
<unk> has the <unk> , who has to help him to stop and the . 
he gave them the chance to get out of the state of " the . " 
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities . 
so my suggestion is to make young people to people , and , and they their own innovations , and they 're going to tell more about flowers and " the " instead of the and " 
thank you very much . 
so during my childhood , it was one of my favorite the , looking at the on the of , because my parents , happiness . happiness . 
but these are hard to find . 
they 're from sand , barely . 
but after a certain period , i had developed a . 
i began to see shapes , and patterns that helped me , they them . 
and it turned to find a passion to find things , to love , and . 
and when i started studying , i realized that see me with my eyes . 
because suddenly grew up into a small beach in egypt to a the miles , along the <unk> , and my the grew to the size of cities . 
that led me to use . 
i had to see differently to see the past in a map . 
so i want to show you how we example to differently , if we use . 
this is a gentleman that went in eastern called the . 
and the <unk> appears , brown , we use it , but , and it with color , this is suddenly a sudden suddenly the . 
what you see seeing here is the chemical changes the landscape of landscape and with the ancient egyptians . 
so what i want to share with you today is how we used to used to build a city , which is called the names and for thousands of years . 
<unk> was the capital of the old egypt , more than years ago , a called the <unk> , years ago . 
the mall is in the world , and it 's very efficient , because it 's in the middle realm in the arts of art , architecture and religion and religion . 
and always knew that the of the would go down to the near the , from the two , here , with the red , but somewhere in this massive . 
this area is huge -- it 's four times four times three times . 
at the same time , the straight directly to over the , and over its time , changed and moving towards the west , it 's the city . 
so how do you find a city in an individual landscape . 
they happened to be able to find the equivalent to find the needle in the brain , with eyes and the . 
that 's why we used the <unk> to map a map of the landscape to order to be able to see changes . 
where the price of the <unk> used to be used . 
but you can see , and it 's very interesting to see this easy the , with the circle that us as a possible position for the city . 
so we worked with scientists together to see what you can see here . 
it 's like the ice in ice , just instead of the layers , change , climate change , you search layers , your human . 
in a depth of five meters , under an thin layer of , we found a density layer from the . 
and it shows that of this possible position , for five meters , in five meters , we can find a over a hundred years , to up to the rich realm , to the to the <unk> that we get the existence of
we found the <unk> -- the , the , the and the -- which shows that here has a chicken . 
it does n't seem to look like much , but if you look at the <unk> stones , which were being used by the in the rich , you find exactly these stones . 
so what we found is a density layer of the that on the rich . 
we also found some evidence for a the for the society , which shows showing that there was a very important city . 
but it did n't get there yet , but we 're going to get back to these new soon to a map . 
what 's more important , we used to the for young who are in school , so that they are able to make great discoveries . 
that 's why i wanted to leave with my the from the middle , -- it may be the in the city of the <unk> years ago . 
" knowledge sharing is the biggest of . 
there 's nothing happening in the . " 
ted was n't 1984 in 1984 . 
ideas , in fact , actually did n't even know about a long ago , the from the . 
you can be able to compare the on the in the . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
i grew up in taiwan as an daughter of a teacher , to my beautiful memories , like my mom to me the beauty , the and the form of chinese . 
after all , i was fascinated by this incredible language . 
but for a , it seems to be as like the great wall of china . 
so in the last few years , i 've been wondering how i can get this wall , so everyone anyone who has to be interested in this complex , and understand and understand . 
i thought that was a new method way to learn chinese . 
since the five , i 've learned every single every single every single in every in the right . 
in the next 15 years , i gave every new every day . 
there 's only five minutes for have to have a , and it 's very useful . 
a chinese the has about 20,000 . 
you only need 1,000 thousand for a simple the . 
the most 200 to give them 40 to 40 percent of the simple literature , it 's enough to enough the , and , and the of the time . 
today , let me start with eight to show you how the method works . 
are you ready ? 
open your mouth as possible , until it 's . 
it 's going to be a mouth . " 
that person goes down . 
" human . " 
when the <unk> for fire fires a person with a poor , like if he came up with me , " help ! -- and it 's going to take off the of the , but i like this idea . you take the
this is a tree . 
" tree . " 
this is a mountain . " 
the sun is . " 
the moon . " 
the <unk> for the door " looks like a the from the west . 
these eight are radical . 
they are the <unk> to create a variety of . 
a human . 
if someone else is someone , it means " follow . " 
there are more , then , " , " and " a . " 
if human person his poor , he says , " man , " it was so big . " 
the human person in mouth , it 's like the . 
he 's a " , " as the in the whale . 
there 's a tree for a tree , two trees are standing for a the . " 
three are three together for a " forest . " 
and they put it under a tree under the tree , and they have a " base . " 
if you put up on your mouth , it 's called " the . " 
just want to remember because a is tree is a the . 
do you remember that fire ? 
two people are called hot . " 
three fire together a lot of . " 
they put the fire under two trees , it means " . " 
for us , the sun is the source of the . 
two together . " 
three are together . " 
when the sun and the moon together , it means " . " 
in the context , it will be for the next day . 
the sun goes across the horizon . 
door . a guy in the door stands to the <unk> . " 
you put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . " 
<unk> , the . is somebody there ? 
this person the from the door . " , " . " 
the left on the left is the woman . 
two women are stand for one . " 
for example , three women , this is called " the . " 
we 've now 30 . 
with this method , you can put it in the first eight other words . 
so the next group of eight are up with other words . 
with a little bit , you can learn a hundred of how a child - old child . 
when we can make these , we start to them . 
for instance , mountain and fire , so it 's a " 
we know , japan is the land of the sun . 
this is the sun with the " origin , because japan is happening by china . 
there 's a sun called the origin called " japan . " 
is a person to japan ? 
a japanese . " 
the white on the left are two mountains the . 
in chinese , it 's written , " chinese , their political chinese in the dark of the mountains . 
today is called " the . " 
a mouth says the says where it says , stands . " 
that 's the slide that reminded me on the stage . thank you very much .
